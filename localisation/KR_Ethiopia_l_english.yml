ETH_Debt_idea_1_desc:0 "Our debt has reached a critical level and is a crippling burden on the shoulders of the state. People have begun to call the independence of Ethiopia into question because of how much our debt has tied us down."
ETH_Debt_idea_2_desc:0 "Despite our large amount of debt, which is preventing us from undertaking large scale projects, we have managed to lessen the burden it has had on the state."
ETH_Debt_idea_3_desc:0 "Despite our vast debt, which has prevented us from enacting several measures, we have managed to substantially decrease it due to debt management efforts."
ETH_Debt_idea_4_desc:0 "Despite remaining at large, our debt is fairly manageable and no longer as limiting."
ETH_Debt_idea_5_desc:0 "The status of our debt has been reduced to that of a nuisance. However, it still interferes with and prevents us from undertaking future goals."
ETH_military_Focus_desc:0 "We've decided to focus our budget primarily on military expenditure."
ETH_production_focus_desc:0 "We've decided to focus our budget primarily on production and industrial expansion."
ETH_construction_focus_desc:0 "We've decided to focus our budget primarily on infrastructural upgrades and our construction capability."
ETH_Tribal_Intergration_desc:0 "Every since we've begun the recognisation of the rights of the various tribes and their chiefs, they've adopted a much more loyal and co-operative policy towards the state."
ETH_advisors_germany_desc:0 "Our military officers are working closely with German military advisers to help modernise and better discipline our armed forces."
ETH_Food_desc:0 "With the issue of famine now solved, our population and economy have been projected to grow in the medium term."
ETH_Scouts_desc:0 "The youth of our nation, now joining the ESA in droves, possess both noble and admirable goals and will work towards becoming valued and honoured citizens of the empire."
ETH_Slavery_idea_desc:0 "Slavery is an extremely widespread practice within Ethiopia. Despite efforts, which were mostly symbolic in nature, undertaken by former emperors following Menelik II, slavery and descendants of slaves continue to exist and, despite working hard, receive no pay for their efforts. This institution is both inefficient and a great source of shame for Ethiopia as the practice of slavery is seen as improper for any civilised nation."
ETH_Land_Reform_idea_desc:0 "We're now utilising our lands much more efficiently and managing them with modern methods. This had greatly impacted our agricultural output."
ETH_Aristocratic_Army_desc:0 "Positions held within our armed forces are determined by birth and all of the top positions are held by men who are of noble blood and, yet, as seen in the Weltkrieg, of questionable competence."
ETH_Speech_Freedom_desc:0 "We now possess laws to protect the peoples' right to and freedom of speech. Furthermore, we also possess the political will to enforce these new laws."
ETH_Ethiopian_Welfare_desc:0 "Poverty prevents our citizens from experiencing potential material gain and prosperity. We must protect even the poorest of our subjects, to ensure that each and every single one of them can possess an optimistic future."
ETH_Lion_of_Judah_idea_desc:0 "The Lion of Judah is more than just a mere dynastic symbol. It stands for all the hardships and challenges that Ethiopia, the one nation to survive colonialism and even triumph against the colonisers, has overcome. Time and time again, in our thousand year history, the empire has stood tall since the Heirs of Solomon had first set foot here."
ETH_Imperial_Inspiration_desc:0 "Our Emperor is a man who, himself, is larger than life. To any foreigner, he may seem meek in personality and small in stature. However, when he speaks, all listen. He had inherited a broken and bankrupt empire from Zewditu, and everyone can see, yet only few understand, the greatness he truly stands for."
ETH_Working_Natives_desc:0 "Ever since we've begun recognising the rights of the tribes and their chiefs, they, in turn, have begun to co-operate with us."
ETH_Trained_Pilots_desc:0 "A piloting school, headed by foreign advisers, has been opened in Addis Ababa."
ETH_Anti_Imp_desc:0 "Those who would attempt to conquer us continually underestimate our. From Wofla to Adwa, envious vultures attempt to break our spirit and subjugate the free people of Ethiopia. Never shall they succeed!"
ETH_Ethiopian_Guns_idea_desc:0 "By utilising foreign expertise and basing our designs off of external blueprints, we can ensure Ethiopian-made guns, made by Ethiopians for Ethiopians, are of the highest calibre whilst remaining inexpensive."
ETH_Levy_Army_desc:0 "Ethiopia, unlike the powers of the modern era, does not possess a united and organised army. The 'army' of Ethiopia, in fact, belongs to individual lords, whose men are loyal to them and only them."
