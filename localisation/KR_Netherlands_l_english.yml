HOL_austrian_approach:0 "오스트리아식 접근법을 시행"
HOL_austrian_approach_desc:0 "Socialists and Conservatives alike call us mad, but the best approach is not to intervene directly and let the market fix itself while we help by devaluing the Guilder and opening up more opportunities for our import-export sector, the beating heart of our economy."
HOL_werkfonds:0 "노동 기금"
HOL_werkfonds_desc:0 "The best way to work ourselves out of the Black Monday malaise will be by keeping the government balance positive and the Guilder strong. In turn, we can invest the excess money saved into public works projects, but contrary to the social-democratic plan, without forcing gargantuan debts upon our beleaguered treasury."
HOL_national_recovery:0 "National Recovery"
HOL_national_recovery_desc:0 "Plutocratic incompetency has resulted in the collapse of our economy. At the same time, the world becomes increasingly unsafe. If we invest fully in the defensive and offensive capabilities of our country that too will help the economy grow again, but then with construction that will actually help our country's security in the future."
HOL_public_works:0 "공공 사업"
HOL_public_works_desc:0 "By investing in public projects like the construction of canals, city parks and highways, we will be able to restore the purchasing power of the common man, who would otherwise be unemployed, while also getting improved infrastructure in return."
HOL_drop_golden_standard:0 "금본위제 중단"
HOL_drop_golden_standard_desc:0 "We adhere to the Gold Standard so that investors will see the Guilder as a stable currency that can always be turned in for gold at the central bank. An unfortunate side-effect of having a strong Guilder is that it makes it expensive for people from other countries to purchase Dutch products. By dropping the gold standard and devaluing the Guilder we can mitigate these effects."
HOL_defense_spending_spree:0 "Defence Spending Spree"
HOL_defense_spending_spree_desc:0 "We shall bring our military back to the level of the rest of the world. Socialists and other unpatriotic folk are saying that the military should be the last place the government should invest in these times but we shall prove them wrong!"
HOL_extend_unemployment_sub:0 "실업 급여 연장"
HOL_extend_unemployment_sub_desc:0 "Owing to Black Monday, more people are unemployed than ever before. While the conservative and especially the liberal governments of the last decades have implemented basic unemployment subsidies, they were afraid to discourage working if they made the rates too high; couple that with inflation and everyone living of these subsidies is impossible."
HOL_rijksweg_12:0 "12번 국도 완공"
HOL_rijksweg_12_desc:0 "During the German golden age under Tirpitz, plans for building a highway connecting The Hague with the German border were already considered, though it ended up only reaching as far as Oudenrijn. Extending the Rijksweg to the German border would serve as a powerful symbol of our government's commitment to other national infrastructure projects."
HOL_trade_missions:0 "무역 사절단"
HOL_trade_missions_desc:0 "Trade missions seeking to reach agreement with foreign governments and companies are a great way to expand the reach of Dutch business and potentially alleviate the current economic downturn."
HOL_loan_to_shell:0 "셸에 대출"
HOL_loan_to_shell_desc:0 "Royal Dutch Shell has been through a series of rough years during the 1920s. While other Dutch companies prospered, Shell suffered the catastrophic loss of their British holdings in the Revolution of 1925, a situation only alleviated by our accession to the German economic sphere of the Reichspakt. We can give them a loan that will surely turn into an investment beneficial for both parties."
HOL_cut_unemployment_subsidies:0 "실업 급여 삭감"
HOL_cut_unemployment_subsidies_desc:0 "More and more people are sacked from their workplace, and the treasury is increasingly stretched by their demand for subsidies and benefits. If we are not to end up with a monstrous debt at the end of this, we must cut down the money available."
HOL_country_of_canals:0 "운하의 나라"
HOL_country_of_canals_desc:0 "By building canals all over the Netherlands we will keep our unemployed populace working while rejuvenated businesses will profit from the canals and the infrastructure it brings in the future."
HOL_factory_building:0 "공장 건설"
HOL_factory_building_desc:0 "By building more factories the nation will be able to increase its domestic military production. While we are a transit country it can never hurt to invest in other sectors as well."
HOL_rhine_line:0 "라인 선"
HOL_rhine_line_desc:0 "Ever since the inception of the Communard regime in France the godless syndicalists have been plotting our destruction and that of our German neighbour. The Rhine is a significant obstacle to this end and if we were to strengthen it with forts, provided God blesses us, there will be no foreign syndicalist setting foot on Dutch soil north of the Rhine."
HOL_limited_working_week_2:0 "주당 근무 시간 제한"
HOL_limited_working_week_2_desc:0 "The minimum working week is too long, and as a result employers cannot afford to hire as many as they otherwise could. By shortening the working week, employers will be forced to hire more people, thus allowing more people to earn a living."
hol_finish_afsluitdijk:0 "대제방 보수"
hol_finish_afsluitdijk_desc:0 "The Afsluitdijk was finished in the early thirties and closes off the Zuiderzee, turning the Ijsselmeer into an inland bay. The risk of the dike breaking could have disastrous effects however, so investing in securing its structural integrity could hardly hurt. Furthermore it would also deliver much-needed work for unemployed people."
HOL_west_indies_as_tradepost:0 "서인도 제도 무역 중심지"
HOL_west_indies_as_tradepost_desc:0 "The West Indies are ideally situated to be a trading post for trade with the western hemisphere. The America's, far away from Germany's sphere of influence, can also provide a chance to diversify our exports, which is currently overly focussed on the Kaiserreich."
HOL_loan_to_SBM:0 "SBM에 대출"
HOL_loan_to_SBM_desc:0 "The Surinaamse Bauxiet Maatschappij is a mining company in Dutch Guyana. By giving them a loan they will be able to expand their activities on the South American continent and hopefully deliver us more military-critical resources than ever before."
HOL_kill_workplace_regulations:0 "형식주의 타파"
HOL_kill_workplace_regulations_desc:0 "One of the factors that pushes Dutch industry behind foreign competition is our raft of highly sophisticated yet burdensome safety regulation. It's sad, but we cannot afford such things in these times of crisis."
HOL_park_in_every_town:0 "모든 마을에 공원을"
HOL_park_in_every_town_desc:0 "Another manner to keep our unemployed busy is by building a lot of parks. Generations yet unborn will be able to come to their senses in these tranquil sites, that will have been built in these hard times."
HOL_draft_able_unemployed:0 "Draft the Able-Bodied"
HOL_draft_able_unemployed_desc:0 "Many so-called unemployed claim they cannot find work to do; at the same time, we cannot find people to defend the fatherland. This paradoxical situation will end now. If you want to receive money from the state then you'll have to do something for it if you can, even if it will mean that our soldiers will be slightly less motivated."
HOL_finish_fortress_holland:0 "그레베 선"
HOL_finish_fortress_holland_desc:0 "We cannot just trust that the Germans will block dirty syndicalists from crossing their part of the Rhine. By building fortifications in the Grebbe area we can, even in such a dire case as total German collapse, defend the cultural-economic heart of Holland."
HOL_privatization_of_projects:0 "Privatisation of Projects"
HOL_privatization_of_projects_desc:0 "Our investments have borne fruit: companies are expressing their interest in taking over some of our national projects in hopes of making a profit off of them. In order to do this, they will need to hire people, who will in turn spend more money. While we have not fully recovered from Black Monday yet, this will surely be the beginning of the end of our nation's suffering."
HOL_precrisis_export_rates:0 "위기 전 수출율로 복귀"
HOL_precrisis_export_rates_desc:0 "Our efforts to make Dutch companies as lucrative as possible have borne fruit: export rates are returning to pre-crisis levels, and in some sectors even exceed these levels. In order to handle the workload, companies are forced to hire more people, resulting in more spending power for the common man. While this may not amount to full recovery yet, it is possible to see a bright horizon ahead of us."
HOL_less_unemployment:0 "실업률 감소"
HOL_less_unemployment_desc:0 "Our werkverschaffing-programme has borne fruit: day after day, less people come to stamp as proof that they are in fact unemployed and not claiming their subsidies as free extra money on top of their regular salary. It seems we succeeded, and while we have not fully recovered yet from Black Monday, the worst of the crisis' effects seem to have abated."
HOL_more_spending_power:0 "구매력 증가"
HOL_more_spending_power_desc:0 "Our large investments in the military is resulting in people finding work across a number of sectors, ranging from the production of weapons to serving in the army themselves. As a result they have money to spend, which is now slowly kickstarting the recovery of other sectors as well. While we have not fully recovered from Black Monday yet, we are certain that this is the beginning of the end of the suffering."
HOL_recovery_from_black_monday:0 "검은 월요일로부터의 회복"
HOL_recovery_from_black_monday_desc:0 "Our sound strategy to fight the economic collapse that ensued after Black Monday has resulted in the stabilisation of our economy. In all sectors, more people are employed, more products are sold and increasing liquidity is floating around. It seems we succeeded in guiding the country through a hard time, and people are confident in the future once again."
HOL_repay_government_debts:0 "정부 부채 상환"
HOL_repay_government_debts_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact of life that money does not grow on trees, and the government has been forced to issue a number of bonds and requested loans from foreign investors in order to fill the void. It is imperative that we pay these debts off sooner rather than later."
HOL_control_inflation:0 "인플레이션 통제"
HOL_control_inflation_desc:0 "With inflation still uncomfortably high as a result of Black Monday we must enact deflationary measures to get it under control, for example by demanding that bank reserve rates be increased so that they are forced to hold onto more capital. Such actions will help stop our freshly rescued economy from overheating."
HOL_restore_regulation:0 "위기 전 규제의 부활"
HOL_restore_regulation_desc:0 "The somewhat brutal policies of the Black Monday years have served their purpose well, incentivising business and getting government spending. All the same, it is vital that we restore our nation's lost confidence by restoring some of their long-deserved privileges."
HOL_startup_tax_cuts:0 "스타트업 기업 세금 감면"
HOL_startup_tax_cuts_desc:0 "Small and medium sized businesses, or 'SMEs' are the bedrock upon which Holland's greatness rests. With many of them being unable to survive the recent tumult in our economy there is a void to fill, and if we are to inspire entrepreneurial spirit we must offer tax incentives to these small firms."
HOL_big_corp_tax_cuts:0 "대기업 편을 들다"
HOL_big_corp_tax_cuts_desc:0 "It goes without saying that our large corporations are vital to our future economic success. Only economies of scale will allow us to prosper as a nation, and as such we should consider offering a variety of tax breaks and state subsidies to a number of our leading corporations."
HOL_eastern_industrialization:0 "동부 산업화"
HOL_eastern_industrialization_desc:0 "Imports from Germany and the borderlands are the future. By investing in that region we shall be able to benefit from cross-border trade and encourage a number of new businesses to open."
HOL_northern_industrialization:0 "북부 산업화"
HOL_northern_industralization_desc:0 "We have already established funds to help businesses in the north of the country. All that remains for us to do now is to open it up to applications"
HOL_dutch_arms_industry:0 "군수 산업 통합"
HOL_dutch_arms_industry_desc:0 "Our recent efforts to incentivise small businesses are already paying off, particularly in the domestic sphere. All the same, it is vital now that we encourage a number of small military firms to come together to enable them to make a meaningful contribution to our military sector."
HOL_subs_philips:0 "필립스 사에 보조금 지급"
HOL_subs_philips_desc:0 "Philips is one of our most famous corporations, and a global player in the electronics market. By subsidising their developments and research, and engaging in joint ventures with them we can harness them for our own state uses."
HOL_subs_spyker:0 "스파이커 사에 투자"
HOL_subs_spyker_desc:0 "Though Spyker has had its ups and downs, its military value makes it a key player in our country. By investing in a majority shareholding in the firm we would be able to take advantage of its automotive prowess to develop mechanised technology."
HOL_subs_fokker:0 "포커 사에 대출"
HOL_subs_fokker_desc:0 "The infamous Fokker company was responsible for a great deal of Central Powers war materiél during the Weltkrieg, and as such we should not overlook its importance as a potential driver for improving our own air force in the near-future."
HOL_guns_for_mitteleuropa:0 "Guns for the Reichspakt"
HOL_guns_for_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "As we are considered a relatively impartial third party, we find ourselves in the useful position of being able to sell weapons to whomever we desire. The Kaiserreich is the leading hegemon of continental Europe, and it needs guns. We can oblige them."
HOL_guns_for_entente:0 "Guns for the Entente"
HOL_guns_for_entente_desc:0 "Though perhaps we do not share the Entente's proclivity for mindless violence and short-sighted decision making, we do share their love of arms - so long as it involves them paying us of course."
HOL_buy_unsold_civ_planes:0 "Purchase Unsold Civilian Planes"
HOL_buy_unsold_civ_planes_desc:0 "Not every product that gets developed is a best seller, unfortunately. At the very least it gives us the opportunity to have access to some planes at a very low price."
HOL_fokker_fiscal_deal:0 "Fokker Fiscal Deal"
HOL_fokker_fiscal_deal_desc:0 "By investing further capital into Fokker we can enable them to increase their military production output, itself having a wider effect on the nearby arms industry."
HOL_new_RnD:0 "새 RnD 시설"
HOL_new_RnD_desc:0 "The wars of the future will be won by a combination of laboratory nerds and government oversight. With both, we might just have a chance at boosting our research capabilities."
HOL_booming_economy:0 "경제 호황"
HOL_booming_economy_desc:0 "With just the right amount of interference and hands-off approach, our economy has become less a shadow of its former self, than an outright phoenix. Holland is standing strong, and our nation is booming."
HOL_SDAP_question:0 "사회민주노동당 문제"
HOL_SDAP_question_desc:0 "With the Netherlands entering a new socio-political order, the time has come to consider whether to allow the somewhat centrist 사회민주노동당 to stand for election to the assembly that will decide the nation's future. It may be a Trojan Horse for reactionism."
HOL_elect_assembly:0 "새 의회 선출"
HOL_elect_assembly_desc:0 "We must choose who to elect to our new legislative body in order to establish a new constitutional framework for Holland."
HOL_third_national_assembly:0 "제3 국회"
HOL_third_national_assembly_desc:0 "The time has come. The Assembly will decide on who fills each post within the new executive Volksraad, allowing all left-wing parties to have a say in this new political order."
HOL_one_raadspensionaris:0 "하나의 법률 고문!"
HOL_one_raadspensionaris_desc:0 "Unexpectedly, the majority of the Assembly appears to have come to one simple conclusion. There should only be a single 'Grand Pensionary', David Wijnkoop, who shall guard the revolution against reactionaries and imperialists without a shred of mercy."
HOL_council_of_the_state:0 "Council of the State"
HOL_council_of_the_state_desc:0 "The Council-Communists under Anton Pannekoek and his 네덜란드 공산노동당 have taken a majority in the new Assembly, becoming the leading constituents of the Volksraad executive body. Known for their opposition to formal decision-making bodies, this has come as quite a shock."
HOL_vakbondsfederatie:0 "노조 연합"
HOL_vakbondsfederatie_desc:0 "The Assembly's majority choice appeared to be the syndicalist 전국노동사무국 party under Harm Kolthek, who has called for Communard-style rule under a 'federation of trade unions'. The most 'orthodox' of the serious leftist groups in the state, the 전국노동사무국 was a clear compromise between all involved."
HOL_socialist_republic:0 "사회주의 공화국"
HOL_socialist_republic_desc:0 "Henk Sneevliet's radical socialist 혁명사회노동당 party has been elected with a majority by the Assembly as the new government. A new socialist republic is likely to be formed, with less of the overt posturing of the hard-left syndicalists and reactionary-style backsliding of the 사회민주노동당."
HOL_social_democracy:0 "사회 민주주의"
HOL_social_democracy_desc:0 "Shocking many of those present in the Assembly, it appears that the Volksraad elected was indeed that of the moderate 사회민주노동당 under Willem Albard. It appears that, for the other more militant factions of the revolution, allowing the 사회민주노동당 to take part in the elections proved to be a serious mistake."
HOL_peoples_military:0 "인민의 군대"
HOL_peoples_military_desc:0 "The revolution did not transpire just so it could be derailed by vested interests and imperialists within our own armed forces. Serious reforms must be undertaken if we are to purge it of dangerous malefactors and preserve the Commune."
HOL_union_of_the_military:0 "Union of the Military"
HOL_union_of_the_military_desc:0 "While it is perhaps not ideal that much of our armed forces remain unrepentent capitalists and reactionaries, we must work with what we have. Dutchmen, both left and right, must work together for the good of our country."
HOL_dutch_militia:0 "네덜란드 민병대"
HOL_dutch_militia_desc:0 "The way forward for our armed forces is the recruitment of People's Militias to help us safeguard the revolution and prevent foreign forces from crushing us before we have managed to find our feet."
HOL_reform_army:0 "군사 개혁"
HOL_reform_army_desc:0 "With the new order secured in both the Assembly and the Volksraad, we must turn our gaze to the armed forces. Recent political turbulence has left them poorly trained and understaffed. We must rectify this immediately."
HOL_ban_reactionary_thought:0 "반동적인 생각 억압"
HOL_ban_reactionary_thought_desc:0 "The revolution is far from assured. At every turn there is another threat that must be systematically eliminated in order to preserve what we have so far accomplished. It begins with the most obvious dangers, including peoples of German descent."
HOL_ban_capitalist_thought:0 "자본주의적 발상 금지!"
HOL_ban_capitalist_thought_desc:0 "While we have taken care of more obvious threats to the revolution, there exists a lower level, more imperceptible danger to the nation. While small, even simple thoughts and whispers about markets and democracy risk subverting our people's movement."
HOL_labour_camps:0 "노동 수용소"
HOL_labour_camps_desc:0 "Our political and ideological foes can learn peace through labour, by soldiering for the revolution in the mines and in the camps. There, disarmed, they can pose little threat to us and can reflect on their flawed beliefs and acts."
HOL_democratic_workplace:0 "민주적인 직장"
HOL_democratic_workplace_desc:0 "All workers must have a say in the company for which they slave. No longer shall employers and reactionaries oppress those that toil for them - without representation at least."
HOL_mass_collectivisation:0 "대중 집산화"
HOL_mass_collectivisation_desc:0 "A key part of our economic doctrine is the collectivisation of agriculture and industry, lumping smaller entities under a larger and more efficient centre."
HOL_verzorgingsstaat:0 "복지 국가"

HOL_union_liberty_constitution:0 "연방 자유 헌법"
HOL_union_liberty_constitution_desc:0 "Formalising the new political order of our nation with a formal constitution would alleviate the concerns of many, more conservative Dutchmen as well as legitimise our executive in its new role."
HOL_market_socialism:0 "시장 생디칼리즘"
HOL_market_socialism_desc:0 "Just because there is a new leftist order in Holland doesn't mean that we should cast aside all of our old trappings. After all, the markets incentivise workers in many fields, including construction."
HOL_block_german_trade:0 "독일과의 무역 금지"
HOL_block_german_trade_desc:0 "For too long the bastion of imperialism to our east has posed an existential threat to all that is good and righteous in this world. Germany's efforts to smother the working class wherever it exists mean continuing trade with would be absurd."
HOL_tolerate_german_trade:0 "독일과의 무역 허용"
HOL_tolerate_german_trade_desc:0 "For many the idea of accepting the new reality of socialist rule meant sending our nation on a collision cause with the behemoth that is the Kaiserreich. The government however, has decided that continued relations with Germany only serve to benefit our nation."
HOL_join_international:0 "인터네셔널에 가입"
HOL_join_international_desc:0 "If we are to do our part in the struggle against reactionism, monarchism and the tyranny of imperialism, we must join the wider Internationale in their standoff against enemies no matter where they are found."
HOL_european_centroamerica:0 "유럽의 센트로아메리카"
HOL_european_centroamerica_desc:0 "There are some in our government advocating conflict against capitalists and imperialists, but many more now propose in secret a new policy - nicknamed simply 'the Centroamerica policy'. This entails merely continuing our prior neutrality with a new socialist gloss."
HOL_finish_national_assembly:0 "Finish the National Assembly"
HOL_finish_national_assembly_desc:0 "With a number of substantial reforms instigated and proposals outlined, the Assembly now appears to be drawing to a relative close, its primary purpose served. It has been invaluable in drawing our new socio-political system together and so its legacy will live on."

HOL_reijnders_putsch_desc:0 "In an absolutely shocking turn of events, the head of the Dutch army, Izaak Reijnders launched a military coup d'etat in Amsterdam, stating that the nation was in danger of falling to dangerous syndicalist subversives. Holland's destiny is, for now, uncertain."

HOL_VNH_victory_desc:0 "국가재건연합은 최근의 선거에서 놀랄만한 승리를 거두면서 보수적인 기독국민동맹을 대체하고 이 나라를 불확실하게 만들었습니다. 새 정부가 할 일은 아직 확실하지 않습니다."

HOL_CNA_gamble_worked_desc:0 "The ruling 기독국민동맹 has managed to score yet another electoral victory, continuing its unopposed rule of the nation. All the same, its majority has shrunk and it may have to find a coalition partner to continue with the authority and mandate it once had. Still, the status quo remains - for now."
HOL_junta_consolidation:0 "군사 정부 강화"
HOL_junta_consolidation_desc:0 "With the putsch having been a complete success, it is now incumbent on the powers that be to formalise their rule. By consolidating the members of the new provisional military junta in charge of the Netherlands, some much needed stability will be granted to a weary nation."
HOL_intimidate_parliament:0 "Intimidate Parliament"
HOL_intimidate_parliament_desc:0 "The new status quo cannot be guaranteed without Parliament being bullied into handing over emergency powers. Such measures might be unpleasant, but they are necessary to stave off syndicalist revolt."
HOL_alliance_of_the_right:0 "우파의 동맹"
HOL_alliance_of_the_right_desc:0 "Holland's problems cannot be solved by one party alone. There must be unity in purpose between nationalists and conservatives if this nation is to be saved from the dangers of radical thinking."

HOL_CNA_on_its_own_desc:0 "We do not need any other. Holland has only one guiding hand, and it will continue to preserve society until its dying breath, God willing."
HOL_work_with_LSP:0 "자유국가당과 함께 한다"
HOL_work_with_LSP_desc:0 "If we have to work with others, then we could do no worse than the market liberal 자유국가당. While our beliefs are primarily social, theirs tend to stress economic concerns. It is a compromise that does not pose too many problems, at least in comparison to our other 'choices'."
HOL_martial_law_in_europe:0 "계엄령 선포"
HOL_martial_law_in_europe_desc:0 "If we are to safeguard the new regime then it is imperative that we begin crackdowns immediately, and demonstrate our resolve to solve the nation's political crisis.

HOL_rebuild_binnenhof:0 "빈넨호프 재건"
HOL_rebuild_binnenhof_desc:0 "The Binnenhof is a near-sacred institution in the Netherlands, and the arson that destroyed it to many represents a clear symbol of the decay of our state and its slide into political madness.

HOL_red_scare:0 "The Red Scare"
HOL_red_scare_desc:0 "The threat that the forces of socialism and treacherous syndicalism poses to our way of life cannot be underestimated. It is time that we begin making this clear to the people, if they have not already grasped a fact as basic and immutable as gravity itself."
HOL_amend_ambtenarenverbod:0 "Amend the Ambtenarenverbod"
HOL_amend_ambtenarenverbod_desc:0 "The civil service ban has proven to be insufficient for protecting our fragile political system from subversion. By amending the legislation behind it to weigh it further in our favour, we can weaken the grasp of leftist groups over the apparatus of state."
HOL_influence_legal_system:0 "Subvert the Legal System"
HOL_influence_legal_system_desc:0 "Dangerous times call for desperate measures. Though it pains the conservative element in our government dearly, it is vital that government influence over the nation's legal system and judiciary be extended to allow us to tackle the threats facing us."

HOL_dissolve_landwacht_RNF_desc:0 "란트바흐트는 국가에 대한 국가재건연합 민족주의자들의 이익과 일치하므로, 필요할 경우 무력을 써서라도 반드시 폐지되어야 합니다. 네덜란드에서 허용될 수 있는 유일한 준군사단체는 우리 소유입니다."
HOL_syndie_crackdown:0 "생디칼리즘 탄압"
HOL_syndie_crackdown_desc:0 "Our nation has allowed those that seek to do it harm to wander its streets unmolested for years. This sad state of affairs must end if we are to preserve the independence of Holland in the face of despicable Red forces arrayed against us in the south and west."
HOL_break_up_soc_pillar:0 "Break up the Socialist Pillar"
HOL_break_up_soc_pillar_desc:0 "While the Socialist pillar has until now been a mostly tolerable focal point for more legitimate and less violent dissent against conservative rule of Holland, it poses a threat that goes far beyond the sum of its parts. The institutions such as the trade unions could hide syndicalist sympathisers, and this is intolerable."
HOL_anthem_in_schools:0 "Compulsory Anthem in Schools"
HOL_anthem_in_schools_desc:0 "As part of a wider systematic policy to encourage nationalist fervour in the country in the face of leftist opposition, a proposal has been put forward of some interest; ensure that the national anthem, the Het Wilhelmus, is compulsory in school classrooms."
HOL_new_flag_protocol:0 "New Flag Protocol"
HOL_new_flag_protocol_desc:0 "One simple manner by which we can rekindle the spark of Dutch pride in our countrymen is to codify a new flag protocol. New rules governing how to treat the national flag, including its waving, its treatment and criminal penalties for mistreatment, would all be cheap yet popular."
HOL_nationalist_renaissance:0 "Nationalist Renaissance"
HOL_nationalist_renaissance_desc:0 "It doesn't take much to make a Dutchman love their country, it is an easy land to love after all. All the same, it is impressive how fast a few simple policies have managed to unite vast numbers of people around our country's political future."

HOL_queens_speech_desc:0 "While Her Majesty has mostly sought to stay clear of politics in recent months, befitting her position and royal dignity, it has increasingly become clear that the new regime is here to stay and as such it appears that she may soon publicly announce her tacit support for it, at least for the moment."
HOL_secret_police:0 "비밀 경찰 설립"
HOL_secret_police_desc:0 "The current state security apparatus is insufficient for our needs, that much is clear. By establishing an entirely new branch of the police, linked with intelligence and military divisions, we can help preserve Holland's stability."
HOL_papua_camps:0 "파푸아 수용소"
HOL_papua_camps_desc:0 "By establishing new prison camps on distant Papua in our East Indies colonies, we shall have a place to which we can banish all syndicalists that pose a threat to the nation.

HOL_landwacht_as_citizen_guard:0 "란트바흐트 합법화를 시도"
HOL_landwacht_as_citizen_guard_desc:0 "The Landwacht has an image problem, that much is obvious. However, if we attempt to portray them as citizen guards and drill that message into the populace enough, it may just be enough to cover up their glaring flaws. Actually correcting them as an organisation will have to come later."
HOL_outlaw_unions:0 "노조 불법화"
HOL_outlaw_unions_desc:0 "The trade unions, those bastions of syndicalist ideology, pose an existential threat to our nation. By bringing in legislation that challenges the power of the trade unions enough to essentially consign them to history, we can end their despicable influence."

HOL_limit_NAS_desc:0 "It is vital that we demand that at least some measures be taken against the 전국노동사무국, a union of orthodox syndicalists that have the most moral legitimacy of most hard-left groups in the country. The question is, how far should we go in our demands?"

HOL_limit_socialist_parties_desc:0 "One area that is critical for us is to limit the power of the radical socialist 혁명사회노동당, the only hard-left group with parliamentary representation. They have a been a major thorn in our side, and so the negotiations would be a good chance of removing them."

HOL_limit_landwacht_desc:0 "A key part of the deal rests on the Landwacht, the right-wing 국가재건연합 paramilitary group responsible for breaking leftist skulls in recent street marches.

HOL_limit_union_rights:0 "Curtail Union Rights"
HOL_limit_union_rights_desc:0 "If there is one thing that we can all agree on, it is that the threat posed by syndicalism and its trade union backers is existential. However, the 국가재건연합's demands that we seriously damage them might prove to be destabilising anathema to the Dutch working class."
HOL_limit_influence_military:0 "Reduce Military Influence"
HOL_limit_influence_military_desc:0 "A number of senior army figures are public members of the 국가재건연합, even if less politically noxious than others.

HOL_limited_tariffs:0 "관세 인하"
HOL_limited_tariffs_desc:0 "The 국가재건연합 has demanded that we lower economic tarrifs on imported goods, somewhat contrary to their nationalist leanings.

HOL_limit_populist_parties:0 "포퓰리즘 정당 제한"
HOL_limit_populist_parties_desc:0 "One demand that we must make of the 국가재건연합 is to consider their position on allowing constant party rallies. At these rallies a number of young Dutchmen are being radicalised by more extremist elements within the 국가재건연합."

HOL_limit_foreign_assets_desc:0 "Unbelievably, one of the 국가재건연합's demands is that we seize German property in the country. Though this might be incredibly dangerous, the 국가재건연합 have made it a major demand, and as such we cannot simply ignore it."
HOL_r_negotiations_succeeded:0 "협상 타결!"
HOL_r_negotiations_succeeded_desc:0 "It appears that the more moderate wing of the 국가재건연합 were not so unreasonable after all.

holst.1.d:0 "네덜란드는 세계대전 동안 독일 편에 붙자는 논의가 있었음에도 불구하고 중립을 유지한 유럽의 몇 안되는 국가 중 하나입니다. 세계대전이 끝난 후 네덜란드는 경제 호황의 혜택을 맛보았지만, 경제의 상당 부분이 독일 회사의 대규모 투자와 함께 독일인의 손에 놓여 있습니다. 게다가 1920년대에 프랑스가 무너지고 영국이 생디칼리즘에 물드면서 좌익 사상이 네덜란드에서 크게 관심을 끌고 있으며 반동적인 사상에도 점점 탄력이 붙고 있습니다. 국제적 긴장도가 높아지고 경제 번영이 끝나면서 네덜란드의 민주주의는 확실히 시험받을 것입니다."

holst.2.d:0 "1936년 2월 3일, 베를린 증권 거래소가 붕괴하면서 세계는 공황에 빠졌습니다. 이 일은 이미 '검은 월요일' 붕괴라고 불리고 있습니다. 우리나라는 라이히와 경제적으로 강하게 묶여있으며, 많은 독일 회사들은 이제 네덜란드에 있는 공장을 닫으면서 수십만명을 실업 상태로 내몰고 있습니다. 우리 나라의 은행은 큰 영향을 받았으며 그 영향은 이미 전국적으로 분명해지고 있습니다."

holst.4.t:0 "좌익 연대: 자유민주연맹-사회민주노동당 선거 동맹"
holst.4.d:0 "압도적으로 강력한 우파 세력인 기독국민동맹의 형성은 의회와 사회에 충격을 주었습니다. 예상대로 일부 콘크리트 층이 더 작은 종교적 야당으로 옮겼으며, 많은 비주류 정치 평론가들은 이것이 절대 권력을 얻기 위한 필사적인 시도이거나 아니면 죽어가는 사회 시스템의 최후라고 비난했습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 기독국민동맹은 대다수 국민의 지지를 받고 있습니다.\n\n이런 변화에 반응하여 온건 야당은 독자적인 행동을 취했습니다. 사회민주노동당은 급진파를 서서히 잃어감에도 불구하고 여전히 기독국민동맹 외에서 가장 큰 정당이며 자유민주연맹은 자유주의 정책의 주된 초점이 됨으로써 상당히 강해졌지만, 둘다 기독국민동맹과 정면 대결을 할 만큼 세가 크지는 않습니다. 이에 따라 자유주의와 사회진보주의, 중도 좌파의 이념을 지키기 위해 자유민주연맹과 사회민주노동당은 다음 선거에서 협력을 한다고 발표했습니다.\n\n두 당을 합쳐도 기독국민동맹 만큼 크지 않을 수도 있지만, 기독국민동맹이 표심을 잃는 와중에도 기초가 탄탄하다는 장점이 있습니다. 그 둘 모두 좌익 정당이지만 그 둘의 관점은 너무 멀리 떨어져 있어서 기독국민동맹이 했던 것처럼 진정으로 통합할 수는 없을 것입니다. 하지만 이 좌익 연대는 투표에서 중간 정도의 승리를 노릴 만하며, 이는 나날이 세를 잃어가는 어색한 우파 정당 연합인 기독국민동맹, 또는 국가재건연합이나 애국당 같은 극단주의 정당들의 대안을 제시합니다."

holst.5.d:0 "2월 3일 검은 월요일과 베를린 주식 시장의 붕괴 이후 네덜란드 경제는 어려움을 겪고 있습니다. 독일 기업들이 먼저 네덜란드에서 일자리를 줄이기로 결정함에 따라 독일에 의존하는 우리 노동자들은 실업자가 되어 국민 전체에 생디칼리즘 사상을 퍼트렸습니다. 그 결과, 많은 새로운 당원들이 사회민주노동당에 가입하고 있으며 그 당의 정치적 힘은 증가하고 있습니다. 그들의 아이디어 중 많은 것들이 가치가 있지만, 통과시키기 위해서 우리는 그들을 연정에 넣어야 할 것입니다 - 이는 잠재적으로 위험한 선택입니다."
holst.5.a:0 "좋은 징조가 아니군..."

holst.6.t:0 "기둥의 붕괴"
holst.6.d:0 "네덜란드 사회는 기둥이라는 오랫동안 분리된 사회 집단으로 고도로 계층화돼 있었습니다. 이 기둥들은 신문사, 방송사, 당, 노조, 농민협회, 은행, 학교, 병원, 대학, 스카우트단, 스포츠 클럽 등 그들만의 사회기관을 가지고 있습니다. 몇몇 회사들은 심지어 특정한 종교나 사상을 가진 사람만을 뽑기도 합니다. 이로 인해 많은 사람들은 그들이 속해있는 기둥 밖의 사람들과 개인적인 접촉을 가지지 않습니다. \n\n하지만 최근 경제 위기로 이 질서가 근본적으로 뒤흔들렸습니다. 경제적인 어려움으로 사회주의 이념이 그 기둥 밖으로 퍼져나가고 있으며, 생디칼리스트와 의회 공산주의자들은 파리에서 흘러나오는 미사여구에 취해 이를 부추기고 있습니다. 동시에, 전통적으로 극우 기둥에 속해있던 많은 청소년들과 실업자들은 자신들이 빼앗기고 버림받았다고 여기고 있으며, 네덜란드 왕국의 안정과 번영을 되찾기 위해 국가재건연합과 같은 급진 국가주의 정당으로 눈을 돌리고 있습니다."
holst.6.a:0 "신이시여, 안돼!"

holst.7.t:0 "기독국민동맹의 형성"
holst.7.d:0 "지난 십여년 동안, 다양한 종교 정당들이 네덜란드 의회의 다수를 차지했습니다. 칼뱅교인 반혁명파당과 기독역사연합, 그리고 가톨릭인 로마가톨릭국가당은 정부에서 대다수를 차지하고 있으며, 대부분의 장관이 여기서 나왔습니다.\n\n하지만 그들은 이제 더이상 그들 각각의 기둥이 무조건적으로 확고한 지지를 보내줄 것이라고 기대할 수 없게 되었습니다. 아직 자신들의 영역에서 우세하기는 하지만, 그들은 극좌와 극우 비주류 운동으로 지지를 잃고 있으며, 심지어 온건한 대중들 사이에서도 좌익자유주의와 사회진보주의에 빠지는 사람들이 늘어나고 있습니다. 이 정당들이 표를 잃으면서, 그들은 이제 그 기둥이 일상생활에서 엄격히 분리되었음에도 불구하고 당의 노선을 지워가면서까지 수십년간 이어진 협동을 이용하려고 하고 있습니다.\n\n기독국민동맹의 설립은 장기적으로 표를 잃을 수도 있지만, 의회 의석의 통합과 대중의 지지로 기독국민동맹은 다른 작은 정당보다 훨씬 큰 정치적 힘을 가지고 있습니다.\n\n이것이 지지 기반을 잃는 것을 막기에 충분할지, 아니면 정치에서 신의 우위가 끝날지는 시간만이 말해줄 것입니다..."
holst.7.a:0 "믿음 속에서 통합."

holst.8.t:0 "자유주의의 위기"
holst.8.d:0 "네덜란드에서 자유주의는 위협받고 있습니다. 가장 큰 진보 정당인 전통주의 자유국가당은 최근 몇년간 꾸준히 입지를 잃어 왔습니다. 기존 체제의 실패에 환멸을 느낀 많은 당원들이 국가재건연합의 급진국가주의 쪽으로 발길을 돌리고 있으며 이제 기독국민동맹과 같은 거대한 권력 집단의 조짐도 보이고 있습니다. 이로인해 다른 정당보다 훨씬 느린 속도로 당원을 잃고 있는 좌익 성향의 자유민주연맹이 국내 최대의 진보 정당이 되었습니다.\n\n올해 그들이 선거에서 이길 가능성은 거의 없지만, 자유국가당은 그들이 보수적이고 갈수록 권위적으로 변하는 기독국민동맹에 비해 온건하고 믿을만한 대안으로 보여지기를 기대하고 있습니다."
holst.8.a:0 "힘든 시기지만, 자유주의의 횃불은 아직 꺼지지 않았다."

holst.9.t:0 "급진 좌파의 부상"
holst.9.d:0 "사회민주노동당의 공동창당자 P.J. 트룰스트라가 1918년 네덜란드 공화국을 세우려다 실패한 후, 그들의 동지인 사회민주노동당의 온건파가 미적지근하게 반응하자 더 급진적인 혁명분자들은 더 뜻이 맞는 단체에서 구체제를 전복시키겠다는 희망을 쫓기위해 사회진보주의자들을 버렸습니다.\n\n사회민주노동당이 약간 우파로 기운 것은 스스로를 트룰스트라의 후계자로 보고 체제를 전복시키기 위해 체제 안에 있는 상대적으로 작은 정당인 혁명사회노동당) 내 그들의 급진적인 상대를 대담하게 만들었을 뿐입니다. \n\n더 나아가 전통적인 의회 정치의 영역 밖에서도, 전국노동사무국, 또는 전국노동사무국은 네덜란드의 주요 생디칼리즘 노동 단체이며 파리의 암묵적인 지원과 함께 구체제를 전부 대체하고 프랑스 모델에 따라 재구성하려고 합니다.\n\n많은 면에서 비슷하게, 의회공산주의자들과 선거를 거부하는 KAPD는 천문학자이자 마르크스주의 이론가인 안토니 파네쿡을 지지합니다.\n\n심지어 일부에서는 생디칼리즘/의회공산주의적 접근이 너무 보수적이라고 생각하는 사람들도 있습니다. '애국당', 다비드 빈쿠프와 파울 드 흐로트가 이끄는 권위사회주의자들은 자신들을 혁명의 수호자로 여기며 새로운 '엘리트 주의'로 전락하는 경향을 막으려고 합니다. 그들의 생각 중 많은 것들이 최근 인터네셔널에서 전위 사상으로 구분된 사상과 일치합니다.\n\n이 모든 파벌들이 네덜란드 역사에 자신의 발자취를 남길 수 있는 기회를 놓고 경쟁하고 있는 가운데, 의회민주주의 체제는 완전히 그리고 진정으로 좌파에서부터 공격을 받고 있습니다."

holpostel.1.d:0 "Marinus van der Lubbe, a syndicalist already notorious for his pyromania, has set fire to the Binnenhof, the seat of the Dutch government.\nAlready the VNH has called for a country-wide attack on left-wing elements of any kind and it remains to be seen whether we can avoid such an outcome after this.\nThe left meanwhile, has sought to prove that the fire was caused by the VNH in an attempt to frame them, but no one really considers that a realistic scenario, considering Van der Lubbe's history and the fact that he was apprehended at the very scene of the fire."
holpostel.1.a:0 "개의치 말고 전진하라!"
holpostel.1.b:0 "비상 사태를 선포하라!"

holpostel.2.t:0 "반-생디칼리즘 폭동"
holpostel.2.d:0 "The rhetoric of the VNH, and especially its deputy leader Cornelis van Geelkerken, seems to have taken grip on the Dutch populace. Moderates who earlier might have dismissed the party as paranoid radicals have now taken up arms en-masse to join the VNH's calls for organised action against what they have labelled a systematic attempt to bring revolution to the Netherlands.\n\nThe results of this hostile rhetoric have been riots across the nation targeting known socialists as well as a number of leftist institutions. There have even been reports of Landwacht-backed attempts to break into the SDAP party headquarters hoping to take control over membership records. Some have suggested this was done in order to assist nationwide attacks on everything leftwards of the VDB.\n\nWhat should our response be to this upsurge in violence?"
holpostel.2.a:0 "Let the riots take place."
holpostel.2.b:0 "Have the police intervene."

holpostel.3.t:0 "흐로닝언 반란"
holpostel.3.d:0 "The northern part of the Netherlands has always been an unashamedly red bastion, a view that has unfortunately been reinforced today as a mutiny on a small military vessel near the island of Schiermonnikoog resulted in disaster.\n\nThe left-wing mutineers sailed to Groningen, where they rallied elements of the local populace and took over a military armoury. Within hours more forces stationed in the area had joined the revolt. Soon after this David Wijnkoop appeared on the radio through a hijacked radio station declaring that hatred towards the left 'is institutionalised' and that the Binnenhof Fire was a signal for a new revolution.\n\nWhen the national government tried to direct the military to put down the revolt it appeared a good part of the armed forces, even in the rest of the country, mutinied in favour of the reds. A syndicalist takeover now seems inevitable!"
holpostel.3.a:0 "Lang leve de revolutie!"
holpostel.3.b:0 "We'll put down the revolt."

holpostel.5.t:0 "네덜란드 망명 정부"
holpostel.5.d:0 "Not long after the traditional government was overthrown, a government-in-exile was formed in Batavia by the Queen, much like how France and Britain used their colonial possessions as a basis for resistance against the syndicalist government that had taken over their mainland. This government-in-exile will attract a good amount of aristocrats, politicians and other people important to the previous government, hoping that one day 'home' will be liberated."
holpostel.5.a:0 "Our Indonesian comrades won't stand for that!"
holpostel.5.b:0 "Another European regime cast out to the colonies."

holpostel.6.t:0 "Offer the Dutch a Caribbean Mandate?"
holpostel.6.d:0 "After the lowborn rabble in the Netherlands managed to seize power, there was a fear that their colonial empire could be used to spread their vile influence across the globe. Luckily, as it appears the Dutch colonial possessions have sworn their loyalty to the newly formed Dutch government-in-exile in Batavia.\n\nDespite this, the West Indies are difficult to defend from the Dutch East Indies on the other side of the globe, and therefore we could propose to take the West Indian colonies under our temporary protection so that no hostile entity can seize control of it."
holpostel.6.a:0 "It is in their best interests too."
holpostel.6.b:0 "We are stretched thin as it is!"

holpostel.7.t:0 "West Indies Federation Requests West-Indian Mandate"
holpostel.7.d:0 "The West Indies Federation has proposed that they protect our colonial possessions in the western hemisphere until we recover the Dutch mainland, arguing that they are currently vulnerable to both hostile conquest from syndicalists as well as opportunistic South American nations."
holpostel.7.a:0 "Fair reasoning."
holpostel.7.b:0 "We can defend our possessions ourselves."

holpostel.8.t:0 "Dutch Accept the Offer"
holpostel.8.d:0 "The Dutch government-in-exile has accepted our offer to protect their American possessions from outside threats, and has handed over the colonies of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba, as well as Suriname."
holpostel.8.a:0 "Excellent news."

holpostel.9.t:0 "Dutch Refuse our Offer"
holpostel.9.d:0 "The Dutch government-in-exile has refused our offer to protect their American possessions from outside threats."
holpostel.9.a:0 "It was worth a shot."

holpostel.10.t:0 "란트바흐트의 신규 모집"
holpostel.10.d:0 "Following our crackdown on riots and marches targeting left-wing targets, the Landwacht has not only taken over much of the rioting in a much more organised way, but they are also recruiting new members at local police stations among those arrested.\n\nIf we allow this practice to continue we risk having to deal with a very large number of Landwacht in the future, radicalised by their time in the cells, street combat with leftists and a sense of political persecution."
holpostel.10.a:0 "Let them recruit."
holpostel.10.b:0 "Change our policies now!"

holpostel.11.t:0 "란트바흐트와 적색 전선이 프리슬란트에 모이다"
holpostel.11.d:0 "Now that the Landwacht has attracted a large number of new members, it seems that a number of local branches are coming together at the border of Friesland. At the same time we have been observing Red Front stragglers digging in inside the city of Leeuwarden.\nTheir huge numerical superiority makes it apparent that the Landwacht will crush the Red Front for years to come if we let them fight each other, but letting them do so will not only put us at a risk of having to deal with a virtually unopposed paramilitary organisation, but it will probably also result in a massacre!"
holpostel.11.a:0 "Let the extremists kill each other."
holpostel.11.b:0 "Have the military contain both parties."

holpostel.12.t:0 "좌파들의 망명"
holpostel.12.d:0 "Following the decimation of the remnants of the Red Front at the so-called 'Battle of Leeuwarden', many left-wing elements across the country have seemingly decided that the Netherlands is no longer safe and as a result a stream of refugees has been leaving for Communard France in recent weeks. This will surely have a negative impact on left-wing electoral results in the future as well as on their dreams of revolution."
holpostel.12.a:0 "Good riddance!"

holpostel.13.t:0 "Finsterwolde Conspiracy"
holpostel.13.d:0 "Deputy leader Cornelis van Geelkerken of the 국가재건연합 called a nationwide party assembly in Maastricht. During the assembly, he gave a speech denouncing our government as secretly being ruled by syndicalists. The press had previously mockingly dubbed this conspiracy theory the 'Finsterwolde conspiracy' after the sole municipality in the Netherlands that has the 혁명사회노동당 as the majority in its municipal council.\n\nConspiracy theory or not, an open revolt was declared against our government, with members of the 국가재건연합 proclaiming that the rebels sought to end enduring syndicalist influence over the Dutch state for good. This message appears to have been effective at resonating with the population, or at least with 국가재건연합 supporters, many of whom appeared to be more than happy to join the revolt.\n\nWhile initially sympathetic to the government, which had sought to block the revolt by using a broadcast by the Queen, the 국가재건연합's more moderate leadership decided to switch sides in favour of the rebellion, and a populist takeover seems almost inevitable."
holpostel.13.a:0 "The cryptosyndicalists flee the country!"
holpostel.13.b:0 "We shall put down the revolt."

holpostel.15.t:0 "경찰이 반-생디칼리즘 폭동에 가담하다"
holpostel.15.d:0 "Following our lack of action against anti-syndicalist riots, there have not only been reports of the riots growing in size, but it appears that in multiple cities, local law enforcement have in fact joined the raving mobs in attacking socialists. In some cases, the socialists are the ones arrested, in others, local law enforcement have used their weapons against them, instead of to defend them. Socialist elements, especially the more moderate ones, are crying out for the government to do something to alleviate the suffering they have been going through ever since the Binnenhof was burned to the ground."
holpostel.15.a:0 "The police ought to be neutral!"
holpostel.15.b:0 "They have no one to blame but themselves."

holpostel.16.t:0 "Formation of the Dorpswacht"
holpostel.16.d:0 "Following our orders to the national police to abstain from attacking left-wing civilians and institutions without proper reason, the 국가재건연합 has announced the formation of the Dorpswacht. Unlike the Landwacht it is not a nationwide institution, but more of a weaponised neighbourhood watch, taking up extrajudicial policing duties as well as organising raids on the properties of alleged syndicalists and marching along the most important streets.\nMore Dorpswacht organisations are springing up across the country, and it appears that many moderate rightists view the Dorpswacht as a more acceptable alternative to the Landwacht, who are frequently seen as overly aggressive."
holpostel.16.a:0 "Shut every single one of them down."
holpostel.16.b:0 "Allow them to operate."

holpostel.17.t:0 "Dorpswachters Flock to Landwacht"
holpostel.17.d:0 "People who once considered the Landwacht little more than paranoid radicals are, as a result of our crackdown on the local Dorpswacht, flocking towards the regular Landwacht. This is because these radicalised former moderates feel that the government is failing to protect them from radical leftists intending to kill them."
holpostel.17.a:0 "This might be a problem."
holpostel.17.b:0 "Sabotage Landwacht recruitment processes."

holpostel.18.t:0 "란트바흐트 기지 스캔"
holpostel.18.d:0 "With Dorpswachten springing up all across the country, it soon became clear that the people seized by these organisations were not being handed over to the legally recognised police. This has prompted the 'Centrale Inlichtingendienst', the Dutch central intelligence service, to start an investigation on where these people actually vanished to.\n\nInvestigators have discovered that leftists apprehended by the Dorpswachten across the Netherlands are typically handed over to provincial camps run by the Landwacht, where they being held under tight control. Unsurprisingly, this is legally considered kidnapping."
holpostel.18.a:0 "This is fine."
holpostel.18.b:0 "Shut these damn camps down!"

holpostel.19.t:0 "헤이그에서의 행진"
holpostel.19.d:0 "A number of people have increasingly viewed our government as too soft on the forces of extremism tearing the Netherlands apart. On the other hand, the 국가재건연합 and its use of extrajudicial measures against the syndicalists have gained it great support amongst the population.\n\nNow the Landwacht, which has gained a great deal of influence in past months, has come together in Amsterdam to march to the Hague on foot.\nThe Queen, seeing that the Landwacht has now grown so strong and so influential within the military, has recognised that resisting what clearly represents a coup would be futile. Therefore Wilhelmina has dismissed our government in favour of a new 국가재건연합 cabinet led by Swart that plans on ruling the country like a dictatorship."
holpostel.19.a:0 "Perhaps we were too soft."

holpostel.20.t:0 "Rising Crime Levels"
holpostel.20.d:0 "As the recession continues, more and more unemployed Dutchmen are turning to crime as a last resort to support themselves and their family.\nThe result is that the paramilitary Landwacht and Red Front are getting a policing role in those areas where they reign supreme and the police is unable to keep this trend in check. This is in turn leading to growing sympathy amongst the population towards the political movements behind these organisations.\n\nIf we are to avoid membership of more extreme political ideologies growing, then we must stop this, though that will probably not be a popular measure."
holpostel.20.a:0 "Prohibit paramilitaries from policing."
holpostel.20.b:0 "Let them do their thing."

holpostel.21.t:0 "알코올 중독 문제"
holpostel.21.d:0 "As general living standard continues to decline, there is a disturbing trend of people resorting to the bottle in order to forget their problems.\nThe economy will recover at some point, with or without government intervention, but if alcoholism becomes too serious an issue it might affect our productivity even after the crisis. As a result many are advocating the prohibition of sales of alcoholic beverages. Still others, say this goes against the freedom of the individual."
holpostel.21.a:0 "Cheers to the prohibition."
holpostel.21.b:0 "Making my dear whiskey illegal? No way."

holpostel.22.t:0 "Alcohol Crime Cartels"
holpostel.22.d:0 "Not so long ago, the only parties that kept our streets unsafe were political in nature, but since we have started to prohibit the sale of alcoholic drinks, several criminal cartels involved in smuggling or producing liquor have sprung up. What's worse, they are fighting each other for the sole right to sell liquor in certain areas. The police are far from capable of keeping this in check and as a result the Red Front and Landwacht have started to supplant them in keeping the streets safe. Either we rescind the prohibition and give in to criminals, or we keep things as they are, probably resulting in the extreme left and right taking credit for containing the cartels."
holpostel.22.a:0 "Abandon the prohibition."
holpostel.22.b:0 "Keep the prohibition."

holpostel.23.t:0 "'노동자는 맥주를 마시지 않는다!'"
holpostel.23.d:0 "'Arbeiders drinken geen bier' is the name of the syndicalist campaign to fight alcoholism in the working class, seeing it as method by which the reactionaries and capitalists keep the proletariat crushed underfoot. As alcoholism became a growing problem in the Netherlands, and with the governments unwillingness to act on it, independent conservative movements pursuing the same goal started to work together with the syndicalists, resulting in growing sympathy for both ideologies and increasing political polarisation."
holpostel.23.a:0 "Encourage private actions against alcoholism..."
holpostel.23.b:0 "...but not when syndicalism is involved!"

holpostel.24.t:0 "Populist Welfare"
holpostel.24.d:0 "Since the beginning of the crisis many sections of our welfare system have deteriorated, and the country is filled with unemployed people who can hardly obtain the food required to support their families. As a result, the 국가재건연합 has started a nationwide campaign distributing food to these areas and opening food banks and soup kitchens. These actions have created a lot of goodwill towards them and makes it look like, even though they are currently not in power, they are the ones who care for the people.\nWe could shut their project down, but risk inciting a great deal of anger amongst the working classes."
holpostel.24.a:0 "It's good for the people."
holpostel.24.b:0 "Shut it down."

holpostel.25.t:0 "전국노동사무국 Overtakes NVV"
holpostel.25.d:0 "The NVV, the most important social democratic union within the Netherlands for years, has, according to the latest CBS report, been overtaken by the syndicalist 전국노동사무국 in terms of membership.\nThis is a bad sign for the 사회민주노동당, as it sends a loud signal that their power base is quickly leaking away to the more radical side of Dutch politics. It also provides evidence that their pillar, so far fairly untouched by the ongoing process of depillarisation, is now undergoing the same crumbling that the other pillars have felt. The 전국노동사무국 becoming the most important trade union in the country has the potential to be very dangerous, therefore some voices in our government have called for an official announcement that we will not countenance any negotiations with the 전국노동사무국, hopefully limiting its appeal."
holpostel.25.a:0 "We do not negotiate with syndicalists."
holpostel.25.b:0 "We accept the new status quo."

holpostel.26.t:0 "Malieveld Protests"
holpostel.26.d:0 "A huge rally of radical socialists, syndicalists and other left-wing fringe movements has started on the Malieveld in The Hague.\nThey are protesting against what they call the rule of the capitalists and some even openly call for a revolution. The local police is wondering what they should be doing - should they crack down on the demonstration or let it run its course?"
holpostel.26.a:0 "Let the rally proceed."
holpostel.26.b:0 "Shut that red scum gathering down."

holpostel.27.t:0 "2월 파업"
holpostel.27.d:0 "오늘 아침, 암스테르담의 전차가 멈췄습니다. 같은 시각, 혁명사회노동당과 전국노동사무국 지지자들은 암스테르담의 회사들에 다음과 같은 성명서를 흩뿌렸습니다 - 파업, 파업, 파업! 오후가 되자 이는 총파업이 되었고, 밤에는 주변 하를렘, 힐베르섬, 위트레흐트 등으로 퍼지기 시작했습니다. 이 생디칼리즘이 조직한 파업이 네덜란드에서 전례가 없는 규모로 매우 빠르게 변하고 있는 것은 명확합니다.\n긴급회의가 헤이그에서 열리고 있고 세가지 선택이 고려되고 있습니다: 그들의 의견을 수용하기 (좌파가 원하는 방법일 것입니다), 파업이 끝나기를 기다리기 (산업에는 큰 해가 될 것입니다), 또는 파업 진압하기 (우파가 원하는 방법일 것입니다)."
holpostel.27.a:0 "그들이 이겼다고 전해라."
holpostel.27.b:0 "저들은 시간이 지나면 포기할 것이다."
holpostel.27.c:0 "놈들을 일터로 돌려보내라!"

holpostel.28.t:0 "2월 파업이 계속되다"
holpostel.28.d:0 "Our waiting strategy does not seem to be working so far, it has only emboldened the strikers, who have now been holding out for a whopping three months. Meanwhile, our economy remains largely still, and many who were earlier in favour of waiting the strike out are now advocating giving in to their demands. Unfortunately, the respect the syndicalists have gained during these days will only grow if we back down now."
holpostel.28.a:0 "백기를 들어라."
holpostel.28.b:0 "시간은 우리 편이다."
holpostel.28.c:0 "충분히 참았다, 쓸어버려라!"

holpostel.29.t:0 "파업자들이 직장으로 돌아가다"
holpostel.29.d:0 "After five months of continuous striking, it appears that finally the strikers are giving up. More and more workers have been returning to their workplaces in recent weeks, where they should be, and today the NAS has called off the strike without having gained any concessions.\n\nThis is a serious political blow to the radical left, who have been humiliated and no longer seen as being able to press their will. On top of that their monetary resources expended to maintain the strikers has depleted massively. Still, we ought to be careful, because we've won a battle, not the war."
holpostel.29.a:0 "이러면 어쩔 테냐, 빨갱이."

holpostel.30.t:0 "Radio Rood"
holpostel.30.d:0 "Founded by a group of Dutch syndicalist exiles, Radio Rood is a London-based radio station slandering 'the Dutch capitalist dictatorship' and calling for acts of resistance 'against the bourgeois pigs occupying our country'.\nThey are spreading lies about certain events happening here as well as making up events of their own and claiming that the legitimate media is ignoring these fact to keep the proletariat dumb. The problem is that there is a significant portion of our population who actually believes this rubbish, and we have little to no way to shut down a radio station based in a country our relations are hostile with, to say the least."
holpostel.30.a:0 "Confiscate every civilian radio!"
holpostel.30.b:0 "They don't harm anyone."

holpostel.31.t:0 "French Arms Smugglers Captured"
holpostel.31.d:0 "We have captured a group of French nationals carrying explosives across the Flemish-Walloon-Dutch border.\nThey won't explain their presence, nor the source of their explosives, and after a search the name of a prominent local syndicalist and a location was discovered in one of the men's pockets. Police arriving at the designated location did not find anyone present despite a prolonged search. According to the law, the smugglers will be designated 'unwanted foreigners' and evicted, but the Central Intelligence Service wants to interrogate the men; they might be affiliated with the Communard government which would make this an act of espionage."
holpostel.31.a:0 "Let the CI interrogate the foreigners."
holpostel.31.b:0 "Just evict them!"

holpostel.32.t:0 "French Nationals Confess"
holpostel.32.d:0 "The French nationals we apprehended at the border a few days ago came clean with their plans to the CI after the interrogation: apparently they sought to supply explosives to a local Sorelian-affiliated group in order to blow up the Amsterdam Centraal Station, the heart of our nation's train infrastructure, in an operation that is at least not directly attributable to the Communard government.\nThey have given up their contacts within our country and the police are ready to shut down every foreign Vanguardist terrorist cell residing within our country."
holpostel.32.a:0 "Roll them up and evict the French."

holpostel.33.t:0 "French Nationals Stay Silent"
holpostel.33.d:0 "Despite a prolonged interrogation, the CI has been unable to extract any meaningful information from the French nationals we captured at the border. They are now asking for explicit government sanction to use physical... arguments to convince them to speak. This would, strictly speaking, be unconstitutional, but they are syndicalist foreigners after all."
holpostel.33.a:0 "Permission granted."
holpostel.33.b:0 "No, just throw them out."

holpostel.34.t:0 "French Nationals Remain Silent"
holpostel.34.d:0 "Despite the extra rights granted to the CI in this case, the mysterious French nationals still do not seem willing to talk. Continuing the torture might now result in their death however, so the CI once again has sought orders from the government as to what they are supposed to do..."
holpostel.34.a:0 "We'll keep going until they speak or die!"
holpostel.34.b:0 "It's not worth the effort."

holpostel.35.t:0 "French Nationals Die"
holpostel.35.d:0 "After a prolonged interrogation, that became very emotional for a while, one by one the French nationals somehow ended up dead. Obviously it was purely accidental and of course we had nothing to do with it as we would never violate the constitution by torturing these people. Still, the fact remains that we still do not know what they were planning with those explosives, but at least the world is better off with seven syndicalists removed from it."
holpostel.35.a:0 "Put the designer of the interrogation room on trial for manslaughter!"

holpostel.36.t:0 "Centraal Station Bombing"
holpostel.36.d:0 "The Amsterdam Central Station, the heart of rail infrastructure in our country, has today been blown up resulting in 127 deaths. Responsibility was claimed by a small syndicalist group affiliated with the Communard Sorelian faction in France.\nAfter investigation of the debris, it appears that the explosives used are the same as those confiscated from a group of French nationals that were smuggling them. It appears that this was a tragedy that could have been avoided."
holpostel.36.a:0 "Verdomde Syndies!"

holpostel.37.t:0 "Torture Story Leaks!"
holpostel.37.d:0 "How it has ended up the hands of the press no-one knows, but the fact is that they somehow acquired a copy of the document sanctioning the CI to torture the French nationals we arrested at the border not so long ago.\nThis will only strengthen the syndicalists in their rhetoric that the Dutch government is in fact a banana republic that is violating its own constitution. They will inevitably state that we are not even close to the democracy we portray ourselves as and that the Dutch regime will need to be replaced with a syndicalist model."
holpostel.37.a:0 "Aargh."

holpostel.38.t:0 "Revolutionary Statue Vandalised!"
holpostel.38.d:0 "A statue in Rotterdam erected in honour of the revolution has been besmirched in orange, white and blue by a filthy reactionary. Sadly the response is that more and more young people, who admire the courage of the deed, have been inspired to follow the anti-revolutionary underground 국가재건연합, who are plotting to take down the fragile nation we have just established. If we are to prevent a growth of this form of underground resistance, we must crack down hard on this!"
holpostel.38.a:0 "Crack down on all anti-revolutionaries in Rotterdam!"
holpostel.38.b:0 "Just wash it off!"

holpostel.39.t:0 "Assassination in Utrecht"
holpostel.39.d:0 "Johan Albarda drove through Utrecht today on his way for a public event. He was accompanied by the minister of interior, Wilem Drees as he went.\nSadly, a lone gunman, a member of the 국가재건연합, decided to take aim for Albarda. Sadly for him though, Drees and Albarda wear similar suits, and from his location the gunman is unable to recognise who is who his target is; he has to take a guess. Which man should he shoot?"
holpostel.39.a:0 "The man on the left."
holpostel.39.b:0 "The man on the right."

holpostel.40.t:0 "Assassin Arrested"
holpostel.40.d:0 "The police are reported to have arrested the lone gunman responsible for the assassination. He goes by the name of Peter Ton and appears to be an active member of the 국가재건연합, as well as fiercely opposed to everything affiliated with socialism. For now he's being held at the prison in Vught."
holpostel.40.a:0 "Good!"

holpostel.41.t:0 "Vught Prison Siege"
holpostel.41.d:0 "A huge crowd gathered today in Vught, demanding the prison hand over Peter Ton to them. It didn't take long for the pressure to build leading to the prison kommandant giving Ton up, resulting in him being lynched on the spot by the furious crowd. In the throes of victory, the mob have started to demand that the prison releases syndicalists imprisoned there and deliver other right-wingers to them, presumably to do the same to them!"
holpostel.41.a:0 "Intervene fast!"
holpostel.41.b:0 "They asked for it!"

holpostel.42.t:0 "Anti-Rightist Riots Cease"
holpostel.42.d:0 "Following public speeches by several social democratic politicians, the mobs targeting right-wing figures and groups around the country, undoubtedly stirred up by the syndicalists, have started to disperse."
holpostel.42.a:0 "We survived one more crisis."

holpostel.43.t:0 "Amerikagangers"
holpostel.43.d:0 "Amerikagangers or 'America-goers' are Dutch syndicalists that have assembled in large groups to prepare to fight as volunteers with the Combined Syndicates in the American Civil War. Their preparations are almost complete which poses a problem for our government as to how to approach them. If we let them leave it could jeopardise potential future relations with whichever non-syndicalist power is victorious in America.\n\nWithin the government, most people are advocating forfeiture of citizenship if they join the syndicalist army, as per the law; some say the Dutch expression 'prevention is better than to cure' applies here, and then there are some who think we should just let them spend their holiday in America."
holpostel.43.a:0 "Confiscate their passports."
holpostel.43.b:0 "Warn them they will lose their citizenship."
holpostel.43.c:0 "Just let them go."

holpostel.44.t:0 "Dutch Volunteers Arrive"
holpostel.44.d:0 "Dutch volunteers have arrived to help the syndicalist cause; they are not very well trained however and their division is rather small, so we may need to invest in them in order to make them a significant fighting force or just throw them at the enemy, which will probably result in high casualties."
holpostel.44.a:0 "We need all help we can get!"

holpostel.45.t:0 "Annual 국가재건연합 Landdag"
holpostel.45.d:0 "The annual 국가재건연합 landdag will start in a week in Utrecht, the first one since the 1937 elections. The CI, the Dutch secret service, has found out that they will be announcing a major policy change for coming year and they themselves seem rather certain that this will result in a boost of support for their movement, reinforced by the fact that the 국가재건연합 is encouraging non-members to come as well. The CI has sadly not been able to retrieve information about the said policy change.\n\nSome are saying that the ideology of the 국가재건연합 is dangerous and that it would be best if we stop the landdag from occurring at all, possibly through revoking their permit to hold a rally; others say this gathering is protected by freedom of speech and should just go ahead."
holpostel.45.a:0 "The landdag may go ahead."
holpostel.45.b:0 "Revoke their permit."

holpostel.46.t:0 "국가재건연합 National Landdag 1937"
holpostel.46.d:0 "As expected the 국가재건연합 national landdag in the Utrechtse Jaarbeurs went ahead today. First 국가재건연합 leader Swart held a little inspiring cliché-speech about how much the movement had grown since he joined, but the truly interesting part came after that. Deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming the 국가재건연합's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while also curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the 기독국민동맹 in favour of the 국가재건연합."
holpostel.46.a:0 "I'm glad it's over."

holpostel.47.t:0 "국가재건연합 Landdag in Nijmegen?"
holpostel.47.d:0 "After their permit for a rally in Utrecht was revoked, the 국가재건연합 leadership has now asked the municipality of Nijmegen to allow a rally in the open air. Nijmegen is much more remote than Utrecht, and so it will probably attract far fewer visitors."
holpostel.47.a:0 "Alright then!"
holpostel.47.b:0 "No, thank you."

holpostel.48.t:0 "국가재건연합 National Landdag 1937"
holpostel.48.d:0 "Though expected to take place in Utrecht, the 국가재건연합 national landdag went ahead in Nijmegen today. First 국가재건연합 leader Swart held a little convincing speech condemning the municipal authorities in Utrecht for revoking the permit to rally in the jaarbeurs there. After that, the interesting part came, when deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming 국가재건연합's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the 기독국민동맹 in favour of the 국가재건연합, although the new location of the landdag is probably less ideal for attracting new members."
holpostel.48.a:0 "I'm glad it's over."

holpostel.49.t:0 "국가재건연합 Landdag in Antwerpen?"
holpostel.49.d:0 "The Dutch far-right party 국가재건연합 is requesting the right to hold a rally in Antwerpen. Apparently their permit to hold a rally was revoked in the Netherlands itself and attempts to choose a different location or time also failed, with the help of their hostile government. Now they are asking us if they may hold the landdag in Antwerpen, outside the authority of the Dutch government, so that they can in fact hold their landdag."
holpostel.49.a:0 "Flanders-Wallonia welcomes you!"
holpostel.49.b:0 "Surely their permit was revoked for a reason!"

holpostel.50.t:0 "국가재건연합 National Landdag 1937"

First 국가재건연합 leader Swart held a little convincing speech condemning us for trying to stop their landdag. After that, the interesting part came, when deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming 국가재건연합's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the 기독국민동맹 in favour of the 국가재건연합, although most would-be new members probably won't like having to go to Flanders-Wallonia to attend the rally."
holpostel.50.a:0 "I'm glad it's over."

holpostel.51.t:0 "국가재건연합 National Landdag Cancelled"
holpostel.51.d:0 "Following the failure to find a location to hold the landdag, the 국가재건연합 leadership has declared the cancellation of the annual landdag of 1937 and condemned us for being the primary cause for it. They also said that they won't let themselves be muzzled and that the landdag of 1938 will be held properly prepared to deal with another so-called cowardly attempt by the government to stop them."
holpostel.51.a:0 "Take that, populists!"

holpostel.52.t:0 "국가재건연합 Demonstration during Prinsjesdag"
holpostel.52.d:0 "Prinsjesdag is the day the Dutch government publicises its plans for spending for the next year: the Queen will read out the annual plans of the government and it is usually a festive affair, however this year the 국가재건연합 has started a demonstration along the road where the Queen will pass, flying their black flags, beating up alleged syndicalists and using their party greeting 'houzee' towards Cornelis van Geelkerken, deputy leader of the 국가재건연합, who is present. The mayor of The Hague wants to let the police break up the demonstration as he fears it would pose a threat to public order and the safety of the royal family. On the other hand, the 국가재건연합-opposition in the municipal council of The Hague says this is an essential part of freedom of speech and asserts that the 국가재건연합 will not attack the Royal family."
holpostel.52.a:0 "Remove them."
holpostel.52.b:0 "Let them hold their silly little protest."

holpostel.53.t:0 "Nationaal Herstel Expands"
holpostel.53.d:0 "The far-right newspaper 'Nationaal Herstel', closely affiliated with the 국가재건연합, has recruited two high-profile reporters today. Some consider this a threat as it will likely broaden the appeal of the newspaper that spreads unconventional ideas and is in fact a propaganda tool for the 국가재건연합 and the far right in general. Purely legally speaking however, there is no real basis to ban the paper, as it would be both contrary to freedom of the press and freedom of speech, two values that normally are respected within our country."
holpostel.53.a:0 "Just ban it already."
holpostel.53.b:0 "Leave them alone."

holpostel.54.t:0 "란트바흐트가 파업을 끝장내다"
holpostel.54.d:0 "The Landwacht has broken a local strike today, resulting in an excellent photo-opportunity with the company's employers stemming from the Landwacht's, and by extension the 국가재건연합's, willingness to act where the government didn't want to do so. Some are calling for a response against this action saying that the strike was justified, that the government didn't put it down for a reason and that the Landwacht had no right to do it in the government's place."
holpostel.54.a:0 "Sanctions will be in order."
holpostel.54.b:0 "It's only good when strikes are broken."

holpostel.55.t:0 "란트바흐트와 적색 전선이 충돌하다"
holpostel.55.d:0 "The Landwacht and the National Red Front are clashing today in Haarlem, resulting in a large riot, many casualties as well as large damage to public and private property. The police are ready to intervene, but in governmental circles there is uncertainty as to who should be targeted. Some say that the Red Front counter-demonstration was a direct attack on the pro-국가재건연합 demonstrators, so only Red Front members should be arrested. Others however say that the 국가재건연합ers should not have immediately have picked a fight with their long sticks when they spotted the Red Front counter-movement."
holpostel.55.a:0 "Only arrest syndicalists."
holpostel.55.b:0 "Objectively arrest everyone who caused trouble."
holpostel.55.c:0 "Only arrest populists."

holpostel.56.t:0 "Nationale Jeugdstorm"
holpostel.56.d:0 "The 국가재건연합 has today announced the founding of the nationale jeugdstorm. It is in effect a scouting organisation, but it appears to be seen by 국가재건연합 leadership as a way to expand on the growing appeal the 국가재건연합 has on the younger generation and to set up an ideological base among those that are at this point in time too young to vote but who will attain that age within the coming years."
holpostel.56.a:0 "Dangerous, ban the institution!"
holpostel.56.b:0 "An initiative that only should be applauded!"

holpostel.57.t:0 "Military voices support for the 국가재건연합"
holpostel.57.d:0 "Several high ranking officers have today publicly voiced their support for the 국가재건연합, in particular the more moderate part represented by Henri Swart. They released a manifesto detailing their reasoning behind this move that details how they feel misrepresented by the democratic government and how the government is unwilling to truly serve Dutch interests. This is a sign that 국가재건연합 support may be greater than previously expected. While these are only officers it is probable that this sentiment is present amongst the common soldiery as well, and so some officials have proposed measures to limit 국가재건연합 presence in the military."
holpostel.57.a:0 "Institute those measures."
holpostel.57.b:0 "The military has always been a nationalist institution."

holpostel.58.t:0 "헤이그에서의 행진"
holpostel.58.d:0 "Tensions have been brewing for some time already, and the 국가재건연합 was already gaining increasing influence and popularity over the last few months, but today it all spilled over: a huge crowd in Landwacht uniforms gathered in Rotterdam and they collectively marched on The Hague, the seat of government.\nSeeing the huge crowd, and recognising that a civil war would be unavoidable in the event of resistance, the prime minister capitulated and accepted all of the 국가재건연합 crowd's demands: cabinet would become demissionary, and the 국가재건연합 would set up an extra-parliamentary cabinet which would be given emergency powers. A few hours later, and Dutch democracy was gone."
holpostel.58.a:0 "We will make the Netherlands great again!"

holpostel.59.t:0 "벨벳 혁명"
holpostel.59.d:0 "The Dutch far left had been gaining unprecedented momentum in recent months: record high membership records, influence in all layers of society and a growing feeling among the general populace that the current government is illegitimate. Today it all changed as nationwide, people went onto the streets, openly calling for the resignation of the government and for the establishment of a syndicalist state. Soon after, the petty bourgeois saw that they would never be able to crush the popular revolution and are crossing the border as we speak. The people have won today!"
holpostel.59.a:0 "Set up a provisionary government."

holpostel.61.t:0 "1938년 선거"
holpostel.61.d:0 "As a result of the schism in the 기독국민동맹, elections are being held barely a year after the last elections. A harsh three months of campaigning are now behind us and it is time to count the votes; this will clearly be a referendum on 기독국민동맹 leadership; on whether Catholics will abandon them in favour of the 신로마가톨릭국가당, and whether the 기독국민동맹 base will still hold this time."

We do not have an absolute majority like the 기독국민동맹 had last year, so we will have to form our cabinet with other parties and act as part of a coalition. Time is short however, as the humbled 기독국민동맹 is seeking to negotiate with a wide range of figures in an effort to create a reactionary front against us."

We can allow Princess Juliana to be crowned, but the 혁명사회노동당 and the more radical side of the 사회민주노동당 are clamouring to exploit this opportunity to institute a republic while we still have momentum on our side.

Today matters came to a head as the Catholics announced their withdrawal from the pact and determination to refound their 로마가톨릭국가당 party. Shortly thereafter, former 기독역사연합 members announced that they too would leave the unstable union and thus, with no alliance anymore, the 반혁명파당 has returned as well. So much for united confessional politics."

This has resulted in the creation of a progressive juggernaut that could be a dominant force in Dutch politics for the rest of the century."

At first the right-wing of the 자유민주연맹 saw it out, but now after two months the current prime minister Oud has formed 'Committee Oud' with other former 자유민주연맹 members who feel that the 노동당 has been kowtowing far too much towards social democratic views. Committee Oud has successfully negotiated a merger with the the market liberal 자유국가당, to form a more conservative liberal party that could also be a force to be reckoned with in post-Weltkrieg Dutch politics.

It apparently did boost our party however. With the progressive Dutch population pulling their electoral weight with us we went, within a single term, from a party close to falling below the minimum voting threshold to the largest party in parliament."

holpostel.81.d:0 "The mandate of our coalition government is about to expire and technically we should hold elections in a few months. Many within the 국가재건연합 are arguing over whether we should do this: within the 국가재건연합, the stability argument is consistently raised, and many believe that elections should therefore be suspended. On the other hand holding the elections could also strengthen the 국가재건연합's grasp on power. In the 기독국민동맹, holding elections is seen as something that should be nurtured, if guided. If the elections are not suspended, the chance that they will move through fairly is still highly unlikely."

And they know what will come next: unless we act fast, they'll band together in the north to start a revolt in the hope of wearing down our regime. Hoping to avoid such an occasion, Van Geelkerken has ordered the Landwacht to get as many reds in custody as possible before they seize an opportunity to arm themselves, leading to resistance necessitating major violence. This night will go down in Dutch history as the 'night of dead red rats' as Van Geelkerken has aptly named it."

holpostel.87.t:0 "Daniel Goulooze Arrested"
holpostel.87.d:0 "Our massive round-ups have resulted, aside from the capturing of less important leftists, in the high-profile arrest of Daniel Goulooze, a senior member of the syndicalist 'National Labour Secretariat'. The Landwacht brought him to a makeshift prison camp in the politically charged ruins of the Binnenhof, the question is what we shall do with him."
holpostel.87.a:0 "Move him to the actual prison in Vught."
holpostel.87.b:0 "Interrogate him here!"

holpostel.88.t:0 "Goulooze's Prison Convoy Was Ambushed"
holpostel.88.d:0 "Syndicalist partisans have ambushed the prison convoy carrying the high-profile prisoner Goulooze. Now we may be certain that the syndicalists will revolt as they have now publicly committed a major crime which will force them to openly rebel."
holpostel.88.a:0 "We should have kept him in The Hague."

holpostel.89.t:0 "Harm Kolthek Located"
holpostel.89.d:0 "Despite his initial resistance to the idea, some special tools convinced Goulooze to share the location of his boss, 전국노동사무국-leader Harm Kolthek, with us. Apparently he hides in a diplomatic neighbourhood in The Hague. Deputy-leader Cornelis van Geelkerken is personally accompanying the Landwachters sent to bring him in."
holpostel.89.a:0 "Praise Kees for his bravery!"

holpostel.90.t:0 "Dutch Syndicalist Seeks Refuge"
holpostel.90.d:0 "The legislative building in the Netherlands was attacked a few days ago by a terrorist. Blaming the syndicalists for the endeavor, the Dutch authorities and their paramilitary supporters have started rounding up syndicalists all over the country. Now Harm Kolthek, the leader of the Dutch syndicalists, is being pursued by angry paramilitaries and he is requesting refuge in our embassy. There is a good chance that he will be killed if we do not assist him."
holpostel.90.a:0 "We'll protect him."
holpostel.90.b:0 "Leave him out in the open."

holpostel.91.t:0 "Kolthek in the Mexican Embassy"
holpostel.91.d:0 "After having knocked open the door of the villa where Kolthek was hiding, the Landwacht was just in time to see Kolthek escaping. Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just a few hundred metres from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly, the Mexican ambassador decided that Kolthek could have his refuge, which means that according to international law, we cannot get him. The Landwacht is not officially part of the Dutch government however, and so Van Geelkerken has a choice."
holpostel.91.a:0 "Embassies are inviolable."
holpostel.91.b:0 "We have to get Kolthek at all costs!"

holpostel.92.t:0 "Kolthek Announces Revolt Support"
holpostel.92.d:0 "From inside the Mexican embassy, Kolthek has announced that the reds grouping together in the north should proceed with their rebellion so that he and Daan may soon be free again. It seems that our attempt at avoiding open rebellion has failed."
holpostel.92.a:0 "Thanks Mexico..."

holpostel.93.t:0 "Dutch Embassy Raided!"
holpostel.93.d:0 "After seeing us granting refuge to Kolthek the Dutch 'Landwacht' paramilitary organisation decided to assault our embassy. According to early reports, they completely trashed the building and multiple members of our diplomatic mission have been wounded. Shockingly they've even kidnapped our ambassador, supposedly to hand him over to the police for helping a fugitive. While at least he was released by the Dutch police immediately, this violation is completely outrageous!"
holpostel.93.a:0 "48 hours to leave the country, Dutch ambassador!"

holpostel.94.t:0 "Mexican Embassy Raided"
holpostel.94.d:0 "The Landwacht simply assaulted the Mexican embassy upon finding out that they granted refuge to Kolthek, wounding several Mexican members of the mission in the process as well as extracting Kolthek and assuring the partial destruction of the embassy. They also, somewhat scandalously, handed the Mexican ambassador over to the police, claiming he 'was helping a fugitive'. We've released him at once, seeking to distance ourselves from this controversial deed by the Landwacht.\nIn any case, having successfully arrested Kolthek makes it unlikely that the moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop will be capable of working together in a revolt. Our sources already state that they are currently taking over a coastguard vessel to sail to the syndicalist sphere while the Red Front and moderates began to engage in brutal infighting."
holpostel.94.a:0 "The Mexicans still won't be pleased."

holpostel.95.t:0 "Kolthek Arrested"
holpostel.95.d:0 "After having knocked down the door of the villa where Kolthek was hiding, the Landwacht was just in time to see Kolthek escaping. Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just one block away from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly for Kolthek, they didn't want to grant him refuge, and as such the Landwacht arrested him. Now it seems highly unlikely that any leftist revolt in the short term will succeed, as moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop do not get along so well and the orthodox syndicalists were a binding factor. Our intelligence has suggested that both are now fleeing Groningen by boat into exile as the Red Front and moderates descend into acrimony."
holpostel.95.a:0 "Good!"

holpostel.96.t:0 "Leftist Revolt"
holpostel.96.d:0 "As had been feared, the leftists have taken control of the streets of Groningen, and soon other cities in Friesland, Drenthe and Groningen province followed suit. The rebels have armed themselves and are harboured by a population that supports their efforts to overthrow the government. Unrest is growing in the rest of the country too, and some in the government are saying that it would be wise to set up a government in exile ready to restore rightful Dutch rule in case of collapse. Others, like Queen Wilhelmina, would rather see us try to quash the rebellion with force."
holpostel.96.a:0 "The cowardly populist-capitalists flee the mainland."

holpostel.97.t:0 "인도네시아의 독립"
holpostel.97.d:0 "The Independence of the Dutch East Indies has always been a longstanding promise of the Dutch syndicalist scene, therefore it is hardly surprising that one of the first acts of the National Assembly has been to declare the independence of the colony. The question is how loose should our continuing relationship with Indonesia be?"
holpostel.97.a:0 "Release it as a puppet."
holpostel.97.b:0 "Grant them complete independence."

holpostel.98.t:0 "Socialist Putsch"
holpostel.98.d:0 "During recent times the revolutionary socialists have been gaining momentum at an alarming rate and today the ticking timebomb exploded as what started as a small military mutiny in the Peel engulfed the entire country like a wildfire. Within a few hours, redshirts had seized control of all major cities and the old plutocratic government evacuated the country, seemingly preparing a government in exile in the East Indies. At home, the syndicalists have formed a provisional revolutionary committee, to take over administrative responsibilities until a proper government has been formed."
holpostel.98.a:0 "Breek uw ketens!"

holpostel.99.t:0 "March on The Hague"
holpostel.99.d:0 "While it had already caught the attention of the political elite, the once small 국가재건연합 party has recently expanded its influence at a rapid pace across the country. Today, in a giant demonstration, thousands of members of the party marched on the Binnenhof. The numbers involved were substantial, and realising that refusing their demands would lead to a bloody civil war, our government was forced to step down. A new order has risen under the 국가재건연합, and now their grip on power has been solidified."
holpostel.99.a:0 "We shall make the Netherlands stable again!"

holpostel.100.t:0 "Military Putsch"
holpostel.100.d:0 "While the government has until now been sufficiently capable of keeping the 국가재건연합 and socialists under control, it has been at dear cost. Street fights are happening daily across the country, and as police is unable to restore order, the military frequently needs to be deployed. Today, Reijnders, supreme commander of the Dutch armed forces, demanded that the government declare a state of emergency. The government has complied, and factual power now lies with Reijnders, rather than the old government."
holpostel.100.a:0 "Aye-aye sir!"

holpostel.101.t:0 "Provisional Revolutionary Committee"
holpostel.101.d:0 "We have ended the liberal parliamentary system that the Netherlands has laboured under for decades, and now we need to lay out the basis for our new socialist state. We will need to propose a new constitutional body that is truly fairly elected by the people without parties in the pockets of the capitalists. To organise all this, we shall form a provisional revolutionary committee, until a new National Assembly is properly elected."

holgen.14.t:0 "Anarchist Bombing"
holgen.14.d:0 "An anarchist has set off a bomb in the seat of the local government in one of our cities. We are currently still looking for survivors among the rubble, but it appears that the casualties from this will no doubt be politically toxic to our government."
holgen.14.a:0 "Damn it!"

holgen.15.t:0 "Shooting at Party Rally"
holgen.15.d:0 "A 국가재건연합-affiliated person has taken his gun and started shooting at a crowd of socialdemocrats at a party rally. Police managed to arrest the shooter, but there have been multiple deaths and another group of people are seriously wounded."
holgen.15.a:0 "Resquiescat in Pace."

holgen.16.t:0 "생디칼리스트의 연설"
holgen.16.d:0 "A high-profile member of the 전국노동사무국 has held a rousing speech at a manifestation at a syndicalist-organised minor strike. As a result, we are seeing a spike in new 전국노동사무국 membership in the area."
holgen.16.a:0 "Eh, well..."

holgen.17.t:0 "Strong Debate Performance"
holgen.17.d:0 "One of the representatives of the 혁명사회노동당 in our house of representatives has showed a particularly strong debating performance and managed to convince people of his standpoint around the country as the papers report on it."
holgen.17.a:0 "I didn't think it was that good..."

holgen.18.t:0 "국가재건연합 speech"
holgen.18.d:0 "An officer who was member of the 국가재건연합 has held a rousing speech at the funeral of one of his comrades. As a result, the influence of old guard in the military and beyond has visibly increased as everyone is speaking about it two days later."
holgen.18.a:0 "Is that so?"

holgen.19.t:0 "Groepsleider Speaks Up"
holgen.19.d:0 "One of the 'officers' of the Landwacht, a 'groepsleider' had an interview with one of the country's major papers. He had a strong showing, arguing for and defending a lot of policies backed by the new guard of the 국가재건연합. It seems to have convinced a lot of people that the 국가재건연합 is not that boring after all!"
holgen.19.a:0 "A sad development..."

holgen.20.t:0 "Socialists Block 국가재건연합 March"
holgen.20.d:0 "The 국가재건연합, particularly its new guard, has the habit of holding marches through our major cities to show their strength. Leftists however, have blocked the way, and to show they do not back away from confrontation the 국가재건연합ers ended up using violence to break their lines. The syndicalist counter-attack ended up culminating in a riot. We should direct the police to investigate, but who is to be blamed for this violence?"
holgen.20.a:0 "The syndicalists, they sought the confrontation."
holgen.20.b:0 "The 국가재건연합ers, they started using violence."

holgen.21.t:0 "Landwacht Breaks Up Demonstration"
holgen.21.d:0 "The Landwacht has dispersed a demonstration of radical leftists as if they were the riot police. Some are saying this behaviour ought to be penalised, but others point out that the demonstration was illegal and that they merely did their citizen's duty."
holgen.21.a:0 "Merely doing their duty."
holgen.21.b:0 "They are not the law. We are the law."

### Focus Events ###
hol.200.t:0 "네덜란드 군사 계획"
hol.200.d:0 "Tensions are running high around us, causing our army staff to hold a meeting to decide upon a doctrine for our army.\n The more traditional part of our general staff wishes to concentrate on the defence our country, repairing and reactivating the traditional defensive lines making use of the water to stop the enemy.\n However, some note that these tactics may not work anymore due to the changing nature of warfare, and have expressed that the Dutch army should be a highly mobile force capable with motorised troops and tanks to respond to threats quickly and decisively.\n More naval oriented officers however see the role of the army to be a subsidary of our naval force, with an army of specialists conducting operations around our empire allowing for a small but highly efficient army while the navy keeps the enemy at bay."
hol.200.a:0 "We need to make Holland an impenetrable fortress!"
hol.200.b:0 "Our army is useless cowering in bunkers, trucks and tanks are what we need."
hol.200.c:0 "We are nothing without our empire, and we need the navy and marines to protect it!"

hol.201.t:0 "네덜란드 해군의 미래"
hol.201.d:0 "The Admirality is discussing the best way to proceed onwards. Our resources are limited, so a plan is needs to be devised on how to make use of our naval assets the most.\n\n Some of the admirality place our merchant fleet above all. They believe that if we merchant fleet is unable to operate, our country will be reduced to poverty. They want to emphasise the need of our navy to protect the fleet with fast surface ships, and if possible harrass the fleet of potential adversaries with submarines.\n Arguments to focus on large surface ships to protect our vital colonies from a potential Japanese incursion are also heared. Our capital ships are reaching an respectable vintage and will probably not be able to protect the Dutch East Indies in particular if they are not modernised or even expanded in number.\n\nSome propose the Dutch navy to focus on naval aviation, a relatively new but potentially radically altering the way how naval battles are fought in the future. They wish to see a further expansion of the carrier force supported by a strong naval aviation branch."
hol.201.a:0 "Our merchant fleet needs to be protected at all times."
hol.201.b:0 "The Japanese are indeed an ever growing threat, we must focus on our capital ships."
hol.201.c:0 "Battleships are just floating pieces of scrap, focus on the carrier force!"

hol.202.t:0 "퀴라소의 새 석유 정제소?"
hol.202.d:0 "Curaçao lies in close proximity to the oil producing Venezuela. Seeing the opportunity this presents, Royal Dutch Shell has asked the government to lease a large piece of land near Willemstad to construct a new refinery.\n\n If we agree to this, we will also need to construct new docking facilities for oil tankers to enter and leave the harbour.\n\nThe construction of the refinery will give a massive economic boost to the Dutch Antilles, however it might put us on odds against Venezuela... especially considering the fact that they claim these islands as theirs."
hol.202.a:0 "We can never have enough oil, proceed!"
hol.202.b:0 "Actually, we have enough oil already... never mind."

hol.203.t:0 "빌렘스타트 정유소가 완공되다!"
hol.203.d:0 "The work on the new refinery and necessary harbour facilities is being finished and the new refinery in the heart of Curaçao has been put into operation!"
hol.203.a:0 "Driewerf Hoera!"

holfocus.4.t:0 "자원 탐사"
holfocus.4.d:0 "Although the vast majority of our resources come from our colonies, our homeland should also harbour some resources we have not yet unconvered.\n\nGeological surveys in Brabant have found traces of tungsten, a resource we thus far completly lack. Furthermore, we can dig deeper in our mines in southern Limburg and perhaps find usable iron for our smelters to produce steel from."
holfocus.4.a:0 "Less reliance on foreign steel would be nice."
holfocus.4.b:0 "We could really use the tungsten."
holfocus.4.c:0 "Why not both? We'll pay for it! Somehow..."

holfocus.5.t:0 "림뷔르흐에서 철이 발견되다!"
holfocus.5.d:0 "Our mining efforts are succesful, there is indeed usuable iron in the mines of Limburg, boosting our steel production considerably!"
holfocus.5.a:0 "Fantastisch!"

holfocus.6.t:0 "림뷔르흐에서 텅스텐이 발견되다!"
holfocus.6.d:0 "The surveys were right, there is indeed tungsten in our country. This will certainly prove useful for our military industry."
holfocus.6.a:0 "Heerlijk!"

holfocus.7.t:0 "홀란드 요새"
holfocus.7.d:0 "We have started with the construction of Vesting Holland. The plan will be to surround Holland, the industrial and political heart of the Netherlands, with fortifications so that our defensive positions will be secure in any future war. Should we start construction?"
holfocus.7.a:0 "Begin!"
holfocus.7.b:0 "Rather not."

holfocus.8.t:0 "홀란드 요새의 첫 단계가 끝나다"
holfocus.8.d:0 "Phase 1 of Vesting Holland has been completed: a limited layer of fortifications hopefully capable of strengthening our defensive capabilities to at least an extent. The project is not finished, however, as much more can be done."
holfocus.8.a:0 "Voortreffelijk!"

holfocus.9.t:0 "홀란드 요새가 완공되다"
holfocus.9.d:0 "We have completed Vesting Holland. Our most important defensive lines are sufficiently secured and any enemy would have to go through a lot more trouble to reach our homeland. While perhaps it might be possible to fortify Fortress Holland even more, this at least sets up a basis we can work with!"
holfocus.9.a:0 "We can sleep easy at night now!"

holfocus.10.t:0 "Question of the 사회민주노동당"
holfocus.10.d:0 "Following the removal of the shackles of capitalist rule, the workers have successfully abolished the States-General and are preparing to elect a third National Assembly. One of the first orders of business is whether to allow the 사회민주노동당 to partake in the upcoming elections; most other remnants of bourgeois elitism may not, but the 사회민주노동당 have once before tried to jumpstart the revolution, granting them some measure of gruding respect amongst other leftist groups. Unfortunately the 사회민주노동당 have been drifting to the right in recent years, which is one of our main concerns - they could provide a backdoor to subvert the revolution."
holfocus.10.a:0 "Let the 사회민주노동당 take part."
holfocus.10.b:0 "Reject 사회민주노동당 admissions as communal representatives."

holfocus.11.t:0 "Third National Assembly Elected"
holfocus.11.d:0 "Following an election, every municipal commune has sent their representatives to the third National Assembly. This assembly will decide over the future of the new Dutch order."
holfocus.11.a:0 "Good."

holfocus.12.t:0 "네덜란드가 팔랑스테르에 합류하기를 원하다"
holfocus.12.d:0 "The Dutch have expressed their hope to join the phalanstère research program. It could provide a boon to our joint technological progress... Or result in the reactionaries overrunning them and ending up with our technology."
holfocus.12.a:0 "Welcome them."
holfocus.12.b:0 "Thanks but no thanks."

holfocus.13.t:0 "코뮌이 네덜란드의 팔랑스테르 합류를 허락하다!"
holfocus.13.d:0 "The French have accepted our request for admission in the phalanstère research program. This will be a great boon for our research and development."
holfocus.13.a:0 "Good."

holfocus.14.t:0 "코뮌이 네덜란드의 팔랑스테르 합류를 거부하다"
holfocus.14.d:0 "The French have waived our request for admission into the Phalanstère research program, saying that we are too weak and that they are afraid reactionaries will overrun us and thus get their technology."
holfocus.14.a:0 "That's one dystopian prediction..."

holfocus.15.t:0 "Battle for Gouda"
holfocus.15.d:0 "The Red Front and Landwacht were planning to turn the city of Gouda into one huge riot, but we were prepared this time; in a grand operation where the police, military and intelligence government groups worked together, we made sure we had a sizeable police force ready. Using that force, we took down local leadership of both sides, dispersing the crowds. Even if there had been some deaths, it is clear that every would-be fight between them will be met with the same force, until they run out of fighting power."
holfocus.15.a:0 "That's good."

holfocus.16.t:0 "Rebuilding the Binnenhof"
holfocus.16.d:0 "Now that the filthy syndicalists have burned down the Binnenhof, it is up to us to build a replacement so that our centre of power is sheltered and that our government can once again function in The Hague, rather than Amsterdam where we are now temporarily located."
holfocus.16.a:0 "In these times of crisis, we should keep it small."
holfocus.16.b:0 "Just rebuild the old Binnenhof."
holfocus.16.c:0 "Create a giant art-deco style testament to the Dutch spirit!"

holfocus.17.t:0 "파푸아 수용소"
holfocus.17.d:0 "While camps in West Guinea were always used to store dissidents in the Indies, shipping syndicalists from the mainland Netherlands is actually something we have yet to put into practice despite suggestions. The great advantage of camps in New Guinea compared to a prison in Vught is that syndicalists cannot just flee for France or Britain upon escape and the thick jungle and rumours of native man-eating tribes were a good reason to continue labouring. Following the building of several new camps, there is now room for syndicalists to be arrested and shipped there en-masse."
holfocus.17.a:0 "Let them fester on that malaria-ridden rock."

holfocus.18.t:0 "Zonderlinge Zaterdag"
holfocus.18.d:0 "Early this morning, the Landwacht was found to be unusually active on the streets of Amsterdam. Around 10 a group of around seventy-five Landwachters were spotted marching into the Palace on the edge of Dam Square, the place where Henri Swart's office is. Upon entry into the office their intentions have quickly become clear: they are demanding that Swart publicly resign from his position and prepare for a handover of power. With Swart placed on air on the national broadcaster, the nation's fate hangs on a knife-edge."
holfocus.18.a:0 "The police burst in and seize the conspirators."
holfocus.18.b:0 "Swart publicly resigns."

holfocus.19.t:0 "무역 사절단"
holfocus.19.d:0 "The Netherlands, to put it bluntly, is an export economy. One of the main issues affecting our nations in recent years is that almost all of our exports go to Germany, meaning that now that the Reich's willingness to engage in overseas trade has plummeted, our own economy suffers. In an effort to diversify our export partners, we could approach the nearby Scandinavians, or look beyond Europe to the Americas for new markets."
holfocus.19.a:0 "Send the mission to Scandinavia."
holfocus.19.b:0 "Send the mission to North America."
holfocus.19.c:0 "Send the mission to South America."

holfocus.20.t:0 "Dutch Trade Mission Arrives"
holfocus.20.d:0 "A Dutch trade mission has arrived. They hope to negotiate a treaty so that at least some trade barriers can be removed, a highly unusual request in these times of crisis. Regardless, agreeing to it could boost our trade with each other, but cynics point out that this is probably more an attempt by the Dutch to get out of German economic dependency than them caring for our mutual economic prospects."
holfocus.20.a:0 "Trade barriers begone."
holfocus.20.b:0 "No, the barriers are fine as it is."

holfocus.21.t:0 "Trade Mission Reports Back"
holfocus.21.d:0 "Our trade mission has returned from their trip. Outside of great stories of those who came along about what had happened during it they are also reporting on the gains they have made."
holfocus.21.a:0 "Let's see!"

holfocus.22.t:0 "Welfare Negotiations"
holfocus.22.d:0 "One of the first demands the leftists came up with was some limited reforms in welfare and regulation; ranging from shorter working hours to mandatory safety regulation to subsidies for unemployed and those not able to work at all."
holfocus.22.a:0 "A despicably un-Dutch proposal!"
holfocus.22.b:0 "Some reforms should be fine."
holfocus.22.c:0 "Implement all of their reforms."

holfocus.23.t:0 "Communard Diplomatic Status Negotiations"
holfocus.23.d:0 "While most 'conventional' countries have the tendency to recognise governments-in-exile like Canada and National France over the syndicalists ruling their homeland, the Netherlands were also one of the few countries who viciously refused to even de-facto recognising their existence. That may change now, because the leftists demand we negotiate with the Commune of France for a diplomatic mission in the interests of our citizens travelling there."
holfocus.23.a:0 "We don't negotiate with terrorists!"
holfocus.23.b:0 "Fine, but we will explicitly deny de-facto recognition!"
holfocus.23.c:0 "Alright, but we won't say this is de-jure recognition!"

holfocus.24.t:0 "반 란트바흐트 보호 협상"
holfocus.24.d:0 "The leftists are demanding that we divert manpower in order to protect them from 'blackshirted thugs', after consulting our spy in the 전국노동사무국 it was found out that they meant the Landwacht with this. Still, diverting our precious manpower to defending some lefties is especially in 기독국민동맹 spheres seen as completely unacceptable!"
holfocus.24.a:0 "We're not going to do that."
holfocus.24.b:0 "Divert a few reservists."
holfocus.24.c:0 "Give them what they want."

holfocus.25.t:0 "적색 전선 제한 협상"
holfocus.25.d:0 "The Red Front is arguably one of the biggest threats to civil peace in the Netherlands as they have a tendency to constantly brawl with the Landwacht. Demanding that they restrain themselves in the deal is a no-brainer, but the lefties won't just go for that."
holfocus.25.a:0 "Demand must cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.25.b:0 "They may henceforth only defend their activists from the Landwacht."
holfocus.25.c:0 "Don't restrict their rights in the deal."

holfocus.26.t:0 "전국노동사무국 Negotiations"
holfocus.26.d:0 "The 전국노동사무국, arguably the most important syndicalist union in the Netherlands, has the potential to bring our economy to ruin and furthermore, taking at away will damage the influence of orthodox syndicalism, probably badly!"
holfocus.26.a:0 "Demand they cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.26.b:0 "They must merge with the social democratic NVV!"
holfocus.26.c:0 "Don't make demands of them."

holfocus.27.t:0 "혁명사회노동당 Negotiations"
holfocus.27.d:0 "The 혁명사회노동당 is the only far-left party represented in parliament, mainly because the rest of the left rejects our parliament's legitimacy. Still, they are a threat to our current system, as they would no doubt dissolve it if they came to power. Limiting what they can do will diminish the political influence of the radical socialists as well."
holfocus.27.a:0 "They must dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.27.b:0 "Demand they refrain from activity in strikes and demonstrations"
holfocus.27.c:0 "Don't make demands of them."

holfocus.28.t:0 "란트바흐트 제한 협상"
holfocus.28.d:0 "The Landwacht is an obvious problem with regards to keeping the streets of the Netherlands safe, as they seem to constantly start brawling with leftwingers. The Dutch government wants to make clear that the Landwacht should make way for the police to round up troublemakers where needed."
holfocus.28.a:0 "Demand they cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.28.b:0 "They may henceforth only defend their activists from the Red Front."
holfocus.28.c:0 "Don't restrict their rights in the deal."

holfocus.29.t:0 "Military Influence Negotiations"
holfocus.29.d:0 "A large problem iss that a lot old-guard officers in our military is member of the 국가재건연합 at the behalf of their 'moderate-but-still-authoritarian' faction. This undermines the reliability of our military and makes a putsch by the 국가재건연합 possible. We are determined to change this, and moreso by altering their party rules."
holfocus.29.a:0 "Demand that one can no longer be actively in the military and be a 국가재건연합-member."
holfocus.29.b:0 "Make sure that active military personnel can no longer become 국가재건연합-members."
holfocus.29.c:0 "Don't push this issue."

holfocus.30.t:0 "국가재건연합 Rally Negotiations"
holfocus.30.d:0 "One of the most important reasons that the 국가재건연합 is growing so fast in recent years is that Van Geelkerken is holding enormous party rallies propagating a future under the 국가재건연합. This leads to growth of a radical young guard and it is proving to be a threat to our parliamentary system."
holfocus.30.a:0 "Demand that these rallies will no longer be held."
holfocus.30.b:0 "Only allow it at the annual 국가재건연합 landdag."
holfocus.30.c:0 "Don't put restrictions on it like that."

holfocus.31.t:0 "Union Rights Negotiations"
holfocus.31.d:0 "The first demand the 국가재건연합 placed down was that we ban trade unions as they are, as the 국가재건연합's Van Geelkerken states, 'thugs who only seek to sabotage our nation'. This would be neither stabilising nor popular, however."
holfocus.31.a:0 "Strong unions are vital to our society."
holfocus.31.b:0 "Limit their rights, but don't outright ban them."
holfocus.31.c:0 "Ban the unions as demanded."

holfocus.32.t:0 "Tariff Negotiations"
holfocus.32.d:0 "The 국가재건연합 demands that we protect Dutch businesses through tariffs to make foreign goods more expensive. The Netherlands is an export country however and overdoing this is risking a trade war that we cannot afford, so the government must remain cautious."
holfocus.32.a:0 "We don't do tariffs."
holfocus.32.b:0 "Some tariffs are acceptable."
holfocus.32.c:0 "Implement all the tariffs they want."

holfocus.33.t:0 "Nationalisation Negotiations"
holfocus.33.d:0 "The most controversial demand of the populists was that we would nationalise all German property in the Netherlands. Some are afraid that doing this will bring upon us the wrath of the Kaiserreich."
holfocus.33.a:0 "We're nationalising nothing!"
holfocus.33.b:0 "Germans don't need all that property."
holfocus.33.c:0 "We'll nationalise all German property."

holfocus.34.t:0 "Successful Negotiations with the Syndicalists"
holfocus.34.d:0 "We have successfully negotiated a deal with the extreme left. Now it is time to implement our part of the deal and see them implement their part."
holfocus.34.a:0 "Excellent news!"

holfocus.36.t:0 "Negotiations Failed with the Syndicalists"
holfocus.36.d:0 "The syndicalists have left the negotiation as they feel we are willing to give away too little to force actual change through. As such the negotiations have fallen apart and the chances of a deal are now minimal."
holfocus.36.a:0 "Sodding reds."

holfocus.37.t:0 "Successful Negotiations with the Nationalists "
holfocus.37.d:0 "We have successfully negotiated a deal with the extreme right. Now it is time to implement our part of the deal and see them implement their part."
holfocus.37.a:0 "Neat."

holfocus.39.t:0 "Negotiations Failed with the Nationalists"
holfocus.39.d:0 "The 국가재건연합 has left the negotiation table as they feel that 'we are too weak to even stand a chance at saving the country' and that they would have to give too much away to end with a deal. Negotiations have thus fallen apart and of the chances a deal after all are slim."
holfocus.39.a:0 "These extremists really are a piece of work."

holfocus.40.t:0 "네덜란드의 외교 사절단"
holfocus.40.d.a:0 "The Dutch government has grudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, which amounts to de-facto recognition of our existence, something they have not shown before. It could be a chance to make sure our citizens have some place to turn to when in the Netherlands, but our sources have told us that they agreed to do this only by the grace of having negotiated with their local syndicalists, so we could perhaps extract more."
holfocus.40.d.b:0 "The Dutch government has grudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, though they have said that this amounts to no recognition of our government at all. This is insulting, but our sources say this move stems from negotiations with our comrades there, so perhaps we could pressure them into recognising our government."
holfocus.40.a:0 "Accept the proposal."
holfocus.40.b:0 "Demand de-jure recognition by the Dutch government."

holfocus.41.t:0 "코뮌이 사절단을 받아들이다"
holfocus.41.d:0 "The French Communards have accepted our proposal to exchange diplomatic missions, so we are starting to build them. This will satisfy the syndicalists and cement our deal."
holfocus.41.a:0 "Good!"

holfocus.43.t:0 "코뮌이 합법 정부로 인정할 것을 요구하다"
holfocus.43.d:0 "The French have said that they will only accept our proposal if we officially recognise their government, something objectively not possible without repealing our recognition of National France. Besides that it also makes our government look weak. Not doing it might jeopardise our deal with the left though..."
holfocus.43.a:0 "Never!"
holfocus.43.b:0 "Ok then..."

holfocus.44.t:0 "네덜란드가 외교적으로 인정하다"
holfocus.44.d:0 "The Dutch government has given in to our pressure and is now recognising us as the legitimate government of France. Their government has suffered a humiliating political loss while we have gained a massive diplomatic win on the world stage."
holfocus.44.a:0 "Pressure helps!"

holfocus.45.t:0 "네덜란드가 인정하기를 거부하다"
holfocus.45.d:0 "Despite our pressure, the Dutch have refused to recognise us. While this means no diplomatic missions it is not particularly crushing for us. We could however tell the Dutch syndicalists how awfully unreasonable their government was, with their outrageous demands... like... well we will just have to make something up!"
holfocus.45.a:0 "No, its better to just leave it at this!"
holfocus.45.b:0 "Let me think of some outrageous demands..."

holfocus.46.t:0 "Syndicalists Protest"
holfocus.46.d:0 "When we didn't hear back from the Communards, we assumed that it was no deal. However, now the syndicalist negotiators have appeared saying that we made outrageous demands of the Communard government and that we intentionally blew the negotiations to punish them..."
holfocus.46.a:0 "OK, OK, we'll recognise them!"
holfocus.46.b:0 "We deny this and we won't go back."

holfocus.47.t:0 "네덜란드가 독일인들의 자산을 국유화하다"
holfocus.47.d.a:0 "The Dutch government has announced a large-scale nationalisation programme following negotiations with their ultranationalists. They are targeting German property across their country and voices from left to right of the political spectrum are calling for action to defend German interests."
holfocus.47.d.b:0 "The Dutch government has announced a small-scale nationalisation programme that seems to be solely targeting Germans. There has been some outrage in German politics about this and there are calls for us to do something to safeguard German interests in our small neighbour."
holfocus.47.a:0 "The German military will safeguard German interests."
holfocus.47.b:0 "Give it up or lose access to the Reichspakt markets."
holfocus.47.c:0 "There is nothing we can do."

holfocus.48.t:0 "독일의 군사 제재 최후 통첩"
holfocus.48.d:0 "The Germans have sent an ultimatum: either we cancel our nationalisation plans or the German Heer will intervene to protect German interests by force. It appears like we have little choice but to cancel, even if it would not be popular with our new nationalistic partners or even moderates."
holfocus.48.a:0 "They're bluffing!"
holfocus.48.b:0 "We would be squashed under their heel."

holfocus.49.t:0 "네덜란드가 우리의 최후 통첩을 무시하다"
holfocus.49.d:0 "The Dutch apparently think we are bluffing, and have refused to call off the nationalisation. While not attacking now would have us lose face in the international community, some are saying that it is unwise to attack a 'normal' country while the syndicalists knock at our gates. Besides, that nationalisation is hardly a valid casus belli."
holfocus.49.a:0 "War it is!"
holfocus.49.b:0 "Don't act on it."

holfocus.50.t:0 "독일의 경제 제재 최후 통첩"
holfocus.50.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has demanded that we cancel our nationalisation, and that if we fail to do so they will remove our access to the Reichspakt market, which could potentially ruin our economy. Caving in will likely anger our nationalistic partners however."
holfocus.50.a:0 "Thanks to policy and Black Monday we can afford it."
holfocus.50.b:0 "We have no choice."

holfocus.51.t:0 "네덜란드가 우리의 최후 통첩을 무시하다"
holfocus.51.d:0 "In spite of our threats, the Dutch have refused to cancel the nationalisation process. Now it is up to us to decide whether we will go through with our threat or just let it slide."
holfocus.51.a:0 "You'll get your embargo."
holfocus.51.b:0 "Sliding sounds nice."

holfocus.52.d:0 "Following our pressure the Dutch have caved in and German property will not be nationalised.

holfocus.53.d:0 "Our 'partners', the 국가재건연합, have publicly denounced the way we handeled the German diplomatic row, saying that we failed to do what it took to serve our country's best interesdt and that we let the German violate our sovereignty. So much for our deal."

holfocus.54.t:0 "Government Negotiations Collapse"
holfocus.54.d:0 "Following the failure to negotiate a deal with either the left or the right, the 기독국민동맹 and 자유국가당 are both polling at historically low levels, with most of their voters having defected to the 사회민주노동당 and 자유민주연맹. At the same time, the far left and far right are intending to boycott the elections. The 자유국가당 has sought to return to the negotiating table, but the 기독국민동맹 claims the time for talk is over. It turns out they couldn't get out."
holfocus.54.a:0 "We need new elections in a few month time!"

holfocus.55.t:0 "[GetYear]년 선거"
holfocus.55.d:0 "Following the fall of the Cabinet of the 기독국민동맹 and 자유국가당, elections were ordered to be held. The 사회민주노동당 and 자유민주연맹 are said to stand a good chance as their interventions have caused the 기독국민동맹 and 자유국가당 to lose a lot of support and their bad experience with working with the democratic parties had caused both the 국가재건연합 and the 혁명사회노동당 to boycott the elections, at least this time around."

It has not taken long to make a deal with the 자유민주연맹, who are the only ones willing to rule with them. The only dark spot of the whole affair has been that Queen Wilhelmina has refused to give Albarda the posto of Formateur, meaning that it would have to be filled by 자유민주연맹-leader Oud."
holfocus.56.a:0 "And so cabinet Oud came to be."

holfocus.57.t:0 "사회민주노동당이 [GetYear]년 정부를 구성하다"
holfocus.57.d:0 "While the 기독국민동맹 again stood victorious, we unfortunately lost our majority. While we got the first shot at forming a government, we discovered that cruelly we could only do so if we made a deal with the 사회민주노동당 or 자유민주연맹 who saw each other as preferable partners. After failing to find a viable partner, we had to give the 사회민주노동당 a chance. The 사회민주노동당 formed a cabinet with the 자유민주연맹, for unknown reasons, though it is said the Queen was involved in negotiating that."

### Dutch navy focuses events

holnavy.3.t:0 "새로운 O급 잠수함"
holnavy.3.d:0 "The first submarine minelayer to serve for the Netherlands, the O19 class were the largest Dutch submarines to date, displacing 998 tons. They were also the fastest, capable of 19.25 knots surfaced (and 9 knots submerged). Armament comprised of eight 530mm torpedo tubes (4 bow, 2 stern, 2 external amidships), a dual-purpose 88mm deck gun, two 40mm Bofors guns and a 12.7mm machine gun, giving them a very strong anti-aircraft capability for a pre-war submarine.\n\nProbably the most innovative element of the design was the world's first operational submarine snorkel, a pipe that enabled the diesel engines to be run at periscope depth."
holnavy.3.a:0 "That looks dangerous, i'd rather not!"
holnavy.3.a.tt:0 "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible.\n Grants the standard tech tree design."

holnavy.4.t:0 "새로운 식민지 잠수함"
holnavy.4.d:0 "Most of our so called ‘K-class’ submarines are getting quite old. These submarines are specifically designed for patrol duties in the warm waters of the Indies. A new design with the latest technological advances in submarine design will bolster our ability of keeping the Dutch East Indies defendable or even cause the diversion of enemy ships to counter these submarines. With these newer designs, we can not only make them patrol boats, but design them to operate further away from bases as well by specifically improving their endurance."
holnavy.4.a:0 "We'll opt for a more well-rounded design."
holnavy.4.a.tt:0 "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible. Grants the standard tech tree design.\n"
holnavy.4.b:0 "Ensure these submarines will be able to operate far from their bases."

holnavy.1.t:0 "대잠 구축함이 설계되다"
holnavy.1.d:0 "Our trade routes to our colonies are long and so can be easily intercepted by enemy submarines. We can therefore opt to specialise our smaller ships in an anti-submarine role, by equipping them with the newest submarine-detecting technologies and additional weaponry to counter them.\n\nThis will make them somewhat more expensive though."
holnavy.1.a:0 "Send the design to the shipyards"
holnavy.1.a.tt:0 "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible.\n"
holnavy.1.b:0 "Specialise the design in Anti Submarine Warfare!"

holnavy.13.t:0 "Flotilla Leader Cruiser"
holnavy.13.d:0 "As we possess a rather large arsenal of destroyers. rather than building full sized cruisers, we opt for a design which is considerably smaller yet retains its cruiser like armament. These ships will act as the leader of a squadron of destroyers.\n\nThe planned design as is, codenamed ‘Argonaut 600’, has a displacement of just 3500 tonnes, but will be armed with 6 150mm guns, and equipped with a decent amount of AA and ASW equipment. She will also carry a Fokker C.XI(W) floatplane. The small size will come at the cost of nearly no armour protection but will make these cruisers to be considerably cheaper to produce."
holnavy.13.a:0 "What a terrible idea, we'd rather build some properly sized cruisers."
holnavy.13.a.tt:0 "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible.\n"

holnavy.5.t:0 "키크다윈급 경순양함"
holnavy.5.d:0 "Our preceding cruiser classes were far too thinly armoured to contest the larger light cruisers being built by Japan, prompting a new design.\n\nWith these cruisers likely forming the backbone of our navy, providing vital support to the bigger capital ships. With a preliminary design (named ‘Kijkduin’ for now) ready, we can continue with this project or we can opt to make increase the budget per ship and make further improvements to it.\n\nWe can also attempt to bolster our numbers by making these cruisers considerably cheaper, and hope they do not blow up by the first shell to land on its deck."
holnavy.5.a:0 "Good, we need the design as soon as possible!"
holnavy.5.a.tt:0 "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible. Grants the standard tech tree design.\n"

holnavy.5.c:0 "Is a kitchen sink really needed? Cruisers are expensive!"
holnavy.5.c.tt:0 "Cutting corners will make the ship cheaper. Lets just hope she will actually be able to float!"
holnavy.6.t:0 "장갑순양함 설계"
holnavy.6.d:0 "The old armoured cruisers of the Koningin-Regentes class being way too outdated to be of any use to the navy anymore, these ships are to be scrapped or converted to another use. However, the idea of having compact, relatively affordable ships which still can pack a punch is a compelling one.\n\nWith advances in technology, the biggest drawback of a design like this is negated, its relatively slow speed. We can therefore opt for a more well-rounded design, or we can alter the design and choose for a slower but more heavily armed coastal defence ship.\n We can also do the opposite and opt for a lighter version with reduced armament with some extra anti-aircraft capabilities which might prove useful if they are to be used in the East Indies."
holnavy.6.a:0 "We'll opt for a well rounded design."
holnavy.6.a.tt:0 "We already have some early designs which should give us a headstart. Grants the standard tech tree design.\n"
holnavy.6.b:0 "Make her suitable for coastal defence duties."
holnavy.6.b.tt:0 "Alter these ships for coastal defence duties, giving her some big guns... this wont help her move particulary fast though."
holnavy.6.c:0 "Forgo some artillery in favour of AA guns and more speed."
holnavy.6.c.tt:0 "These ships have quite some room for a deadly ammount of AA guns, in particulary if we drop some artillery."
holnavy.7.t:0 "특수 대공 구축함 설계"
holnavy.7.d:0 "We need new cruisers for our navy's intended role and anticipation of how naval warfare will evolve. Cruisers are important escort vessels and usually carry a mixture of artillery, anti aircraft guns and torpedos.\n\nOur single carrier cannot carry many squadrons of fighter planes so we can opt to build cruisers which pack considerably more anti aircraft guns at the expense of some guns pointing towards the sea, thus allowing for more anti aircraft screening around our larger ships as well as convoys."
holnavy.7.a:0 "Such a simple yet effective idea, proceed!"
holnavy.7.b:0 "We need more guns towards the sea, not pointing at the sky!"

holfocus.400.d:0 "Design on a Koolhoven high-performance aircraft first started late in 1937. The result, finished in early 1938 was the F.K.55, a single-seat fighter of radical design with contra-rotating propellers and an engine housed behind the pilot. It had initially been proposed to do away with ailerons on the wings, and replace them with "slot-spoilers" for lateral control, however this idea was abandoned early in the project."
holfocus.400.a:0 "Lets build them!"
holfocus.401.t:0 "포커 D.XXI가 개발되다"
holfocus.401.d:0 "The Fokker D.XXI was a low-wing monoplane fighter aircraft. Following standard Fokker design practice of the period, it featured a welded steel tube fuselage that was largely covered by fabric, including the flight control surfaces; element forward of the trailing edges of the wings were covered by detachable aluminium panels instead. The wings were of a wooden construction, being composed of two box spars attached to ribs made of plywood. The aircraft was outfitted with a fixed spatted undercarriage with cantilever legs; braking was provided by independently-operated pedals using compress air. \n\nThe cockpit of the D.XXI was fully enclosed by a plexiglas hood featuring large sliding sections, and was entirely jettisonable in an emergency situation to enable pilots to bail out.[2] Pilots were protected against turnover injuries by means of a pylon built into the structure of the aircraft set behind the seat. Fuel was housed in a 77-gallon tank located aft of the engine, wing-mounted auxiliary fuel tanks could also be installed.\nThe main armament consisted of two pairs of 7.92mm M36 FN-Browning machine guns, two being housed within the wings and the other pair within the forward fuselage, requiring the latter to shoot through the propeller blades; guns installed within the fuselage carried 500 rounds each while wing-mounted guns had 300 rounds each.\n Upon its entry to service in 1938, the D.XXI represented a significant leap forward for the Dutch Army Aviation Group, whose fighter force had until that time consisted of aging biplanes with open cockpits. The new Fokker quickly proved to be an extremely sturdy aircraft, being capable of attaining a speed of 700 km/h in a dive."
holfocus.401.dxxi-2.t:0 "포커 D.XXI가 개발되다"
holfocus.401.dxxi-2.d:0 "The Luchtvaartafdeling (LVA) consists of just a couple of squadrons of antiquated biplanes... on paper. The LVA is thus currently in no condition to defend the skies of the Netherlands, let alone our far flung colonial empire.\n\nFokker has once again been chosen to provide the machines for our air force, and has a near production ready prototype of the Fokker D.XXI ready.\n\nUpon its entry to service the D.XXI shall represent a significant leap forward for the LVA.\nThe new Fokker possess some interesting characteristics like being an extremely sturdy yet manoeuvrable aircraft and being capable of attaining a speed of 700 km/h in a dive.\nHowever its engine might be underpowered and the twin rifle calibre machineguns might prove to be underwhelming compared to the competition."
holfocus.401.dxxi-5.t:0 "포커 D.XXI-5가 개발되다"
holfocus.401.dxxi-5.d:0 "With the Fokker D.XXI steadily replacing the antiqudated biplanes in service of the LVA, concerns have been raised about the relatively low engine power as well as drag created by the non retractable landing gear. Although the plane is well liked by its pilots, it does have some room for improvement.\n\nSeveral design changes have been proposed, and one redesigned model with an upgraded engine and retractable landing gear is now ready for production.\nThis will provide a cheap boost to the combat worthyness of the Luchtvaartafdeling, as exisiting production lines can be used."
holfocus.401.dxxiii.t:0 "포커 D.XXIII가 개발되다"
holfocus.401.dxxiii.d:0 "The Fokker D.XXI planes are serving us well, but their limited engine power means their obsoledence is nearing quickly. Fortunally, Fokker has been designing a replacement in the form of the twin engined D.XXIII. With two engines instead of one and thus double the horsepower, our pilots should definitely get the advantage of enemey designs.\n\n The Fokker D.XXIII is to be equipped with two 7.92mm calibre machineguns along with two 13mm guns, more then doubling the firepower of the previous designs."

Fokker has presented us with design plans for both, however we lack the funds to build both designs in a significant number. Hence, We should make a choice between shorter range but more accurate dive bombers, or larger twin engined bombers."
