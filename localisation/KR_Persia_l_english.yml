pers.1.t:0 "[PER.GetNameDef] 소개"
pers.1.d:0 "지난 수십 년간, [PER.GetNameDef]는 끊임없는 변화와 불안정한 상태에 있었습니다. Having gained full independence from Russia and the British Empire, we have struggled to find our own place in this world. All around [PER.GetNameDef], from the smallest hamlet in the furthest corners of the nation to the big cities like [266.GetName], we can see the difference in beliefs between the people. Just a few years ago, the Shah himself was shot by a socialist assassin. Although he survived, the Shah's health has been declining by the day. It is clear the nation cannot survive like it is, and with the Shah's death looming, there are fears ideological divide could turn into open revolt. Democrats trying to force a republic, royalists who would support a powerful monarchy lead by the Shah's brother, Hassan Mirza, and socialists, attempting to create the first socialist state in the Middle East. We can only hope the power transition is peaceful...\n\nOur nation's military is in shambles, and we are still recovering from a famine that killed millions of our people. Not only that, our political class is dominated by a corrupt aristocracy, ruining our political legitimacy. Our nation has many problems to sort out, but if we can do it successfully, we could become the greatest Empire the Middle East has ever seen."

This is a great blow to the loyalists and the Qajar Dynasty. However, Hassan Mirza had a son, Soltan Hamid Mirza, who will now take the reins to try and resume stability. Currently, there are two options. The politicians have said that they are willing to negotiate with us for a peaceful transition.

An emergency meeting in the Majlis has been called to decide on the system of [PER.GetNameDef]'s government. Either we could form a fully democratic republic under the Democrat party, that previously ruled in together with the Shah, with elections every 4 years.

pers.20.d:0 "Everyone knew that civil war was a possibility in our disunified nation. Fighting has erupted in the major cities, with clashes between socialists, republicans and Qajar loyalists breaking out. However, it seems our disunity has been somewhat of a benefit, for outside the cities, most people do not care enough about their government to fight for it. This means that the fighting is fully contained in the cities. It will be a bloody fight going forward, and whoever comes out victorious will unify [PER.GetNameDef] under their government, and the losers will no doubt be stripped of any influence."

pers.21.d:0 ", once the capital of Safavid empire, is considered one of [PER.GetNameDef]'s most beautiful cities and has many historical sites. It is so popular that some refer to it as "Isfahan, half of the world". In the past few days since Shah Ahmad Qajar's death, pro-Hassan Mirza forces have managed to seize important locations around the city, like the Chehel Sotun palace and Naghsh-e Jahan Square, in order to stop any sort of resistance from anti-monarchist groups. Meanwhile, a small group of rebels who were preparing to strike the city have managed to capture the bridges on Zayandeh Rud river and destroyed them, except the famous Safavid bridges of Si o Se Pol and Khaju, effectively cutting the royalists out of the southern part of the city."
pers.21.a:0 "Loyalist forces must push, even if it's dangerous."
pers.21.b:0 "The loyalists will try to encircle the rebels by rowing to the other side."

pers.22.d:0 "Tabriz, one of [PER.GetNameDef]'s historical cities, dating back to the Sassanid era and gaining importance as the capital of [PER.GetNameDef] during the Ilkhanate era and the Safavids at their rise and an important economic centre throughout [PER.GetNameDef]'s history, has been eerily silent for the last couple of days. Just a few days ago with the death of Ahmad Shah Qajar, the revolutionaries present in the city, much like 1908's constitutional revolution, began to take control of the city. In a fast swoop of the important locations, including Constitution house of Tabriz, Tabriz Grand Bazaar and Kabud mosque, they manage to almost capture the entirety of the city. While those loyal to Hassan Mirza were surprised by the Tabrizi Revolutionaries, they managed to secure the Arg-e Alishah Mausoleum as it proved a good location to holdout against revolutionary forces, as was proven by Russians who took control of Tabriz in 1911."
pers.22.a:0 "The Revolutionaries storm the Arg-e Alishah in order to defeat the royalists."
pers.22.b:0 "The rebels delay the attack to negotiate peace terms with their commanding officer."

pers.24.t:0 "The fight for 미슈하드"
pers.24.d:0 "The Holiest city for Shias in [PER.GetNameDef], the resting place of the Shia 8th Imam Reza, is currently in a state of war, ever since the Shah died. Revolutionaries, having a small foothold in the city, have barely managed to hold their ground against the high concentration of royalist forces, so they have resorted to guerilla warfare and damaging government buildings, attacking royalist patrols, and blowing supply caches. However, this most likely will not be successful."
pers.24.a:0 "반란군들은 곧 충성스런 시민들에 의해 뿌리 뽑힐것이다."

pers.26.t:0 "The fight for 시라즈"
pers.26.d:0 "Shiraz is probably one of the oldest [PER.GetAdjective] cities to exist, dating back to the Achaemenid Empire and its foundation. Being one of [PER.GetNameDef]'s cultural capitals throughout history, Shiraz has an important role in [PER.GetNameDef]'s identity and political affairs. In the past couple of days since the death of the Shah, the revolutionary forces have managed to take control of different points around the city with minimum damage to famous historical and cultural sites, such as famous poets Hafez Shirazi and Sa'di's resting place alongside the Shah Cheragh Mosque, the Quran gate and the famous Zand Dynasty fortress titled Arg of Karim Khan. While the revolutionary forces have managed to take control of most of the city the Qashqai tribesmen, loyal to the Shah, are moving in to capture Shiraz and might bring the city to loyalist control. Unbeknownst to the Qashqai tribe, the Revolutionary Bakhtiari tribe, who have always been in favor of the constitutionalists and participated in the 1907 constitutional revolution dispatched a huge force to help out the revolutionaries. If they get there in time they might just be able to tip the balance in favor of the defending revolutionaries..."
pers.26.a:0 "The Qashqai tribe hasten their march to Shiraz in order to reinforce the rebels in the city."
pers.26.b:0 "The Qashqai tribe launch an early offensive that could bring the city to their control."

pers.27.t:0 "The fight for Bandar e'Abbas"
pers.27.d:0 "Bandar e'Abbas is one the most important trade cities of [PER.GetNameDef]. Due to its port and key location in the Persian gulf, historically the city has been a centre of trade for foreign merchants and a location where most [PER.GetAdjective] exports take place. The port city of Bandar e'Abbas for the past few days has witnessed heavy fighting between the supporters of Hassan Mirza and Revolutionaries. Although the city was initially well guarded by Qajar supporters, due to its importance, Edalat party members had been secretly importing foreign socialists into the city in order to fight the Qajar soldiers when the time was right. As soon as the news of Ahmad Shah's death spread, Qajar forces began to fortify important parts of the city, especially the port, putting it on lockdown until further notice. Meanwhile, the revolutionaries alongside the foreign fighters began to strike the weaker Qajar positions when they least expected it. In a few hours the smaller Qajar outposts had been wiped out entirely, and when the news reached the Qajar forces it was too late for them do anything, but to fortify the last few major posts they held. Due to infrastructure problems, no reinforcements will get to the city in time."
pers.27.a:0 "The revolutionaries attack the last fortified outposts and claim the city for themselves."

pers.28.t:0 "내전의 끝"
pers.28.d:0 "It appears the fighting has begun to slow down. Hundreds of people were killed, both willing fighters and innocent civilians. Families have been torn apart over political beliefs, but order has somewhat been restored."
pers.28.a:0 "그리고 승리자는..."

pers.29.t:0 "충성파가 승리하다"
pers.29.d:0 "As the dust settles, it appears the Qajar loyalists have come out of the fighting victorious. Any remaining rebels who refuse to accept the new government are being arrested to ensure stability."
pers.29.a:0 "As it should be."

pers.31.t:0 "검은 월요일이 [PER.GetNameDef]을 강타하다"
pers.31.d:0 "The German economy has been growing ever since their victory in the Weltkrieg, and have strong economic links to [PER.GetNameDef]. Due to the size of their economy and our large oil reserves, our economy has more and more become dependent on Germany's. Since the Weltkrieg ended, our economy has been recovering quite rapidly, and the effects of the Persian Famine have almost been solved.\n\nHowever, crisis has struck Germany in the form of Black Monday. The whole German economy has crashed, creating waves affecting many other nations around the world, bringing their economies down with them. It seems one of those waves has hit us. Suddenly, thousands of people have lost all their money and their jobs, and families are going to be starving again. The leadership has met in an emergency meeting to figure out a plan to solve this."

pers.32.d:0 "The Astan Quds Razavi is an autonomous charitable foundation based in [PER.GetNameDef], known as a Boyard. They look after estates, repairing and refurbishing old temples and other buildings, and even education orphan school children. They are a very popular and wealthy organisation, and even have influence inside our government. However, what we want to focus on is their vast amount of wealth. Seeing the effects of Black Monday on our citizens, the Astan Quds Razavi has agreed to give us some of their wealth to help deal with the problem. However, we have a second option. We could fully seize their wealth, giving us more money to work with for dealing with Black Monday. However, their is large support for Astan Quds Razavi, so seizing their wealth will lose us a lot of support from the public."

pers.33.t:0 "Sheikh Khaz'al의 재산"
pers.33.d:0 "Khaz'al bin Jabir bin Merdaw al-Ka'bi is one of the wealthiest men in [PER.GetNameDef], if not the whole Middle East. Having had a share in the Anglo-[PER.GetAdjective] oil company and having received yearly tributes from the British Empire alongside his subjects in the province of Khuzestan, he became unimaginably wealthy and influential to a point where the province of Khuzestan was his personal kingdom. With the economic reforms underway we need a huge source of income and we believe Sheikh Khaz'al's wealth is the answer. If we can convince him to supply us with his wealth willingly we can prevent any unwanted hostilities. On the other hand, we can seize all his possessions which will entirely remove him as a threat in the future and also give us more supplies to work with. Although the consequences of such action will be severe."

pers.34.t:0 "반대파 제거?"
pers.34.d:0 "Ever since the revolution took place and the socialists seized the government, there has been one central question: whether we should work with the politicians of the previous government, or whether we should completely remove anyone from the previous government to complete the full revolution. The previous government, although having the Qajars be a strong force, was a Social democratic one, proving that the politicians are able to somewhat work with us. However, there is the chance that these reactionary forces, if kept in government, will try to corrupt and inevitably destroy the revolution. Although in the short term purging the government will have a dangerous effect, in the long run it might preserve the revolution permanently."

If we want these protests to stop, we must end the political chaos inside the government itself, and create order throughout the nation."

Things are still very shaky, and people have still not fully recovered from the chaos after the death of Ahmad. First is a Democrat-Edalat coalition, with Taqizadeh becoming president. They have formed a coalition due to both of their leaders being close associates, and both working together during the revolution against the Shah. They have some similar views, so can work together fine for now. However, they do differ in many ways, and it will remain being a shaky alliance. The other main candidate is Mohammad Ali Foroughi Zoka-ol-Molk, leading an Tajadod-Eslah Talaban coalition. These parties have come together to try to reduce the influence of the Edalat and Democrat party, and disagree with them on almost every field. These parties can work together well, for the Eslah Talaban, having lost some popularity due to their alignment with the Shah, can implement their social policies, while the Tajadod party can implement their economic reforms."

This time, there is no coalition with the Edalat party, due to tensions lowering politically. Taqizadeh believes in reforms to the economic system to help those who do not have much, like people who were affected by the famine. Second is Ahmad Qavam of the Eslah Talaban party. His beliefs are far more traditional, and believes that usually, less reform is more benefitial.

Second is a coalition between the Tajadod party and the Eetedaliun party under Mohammad Mosaddegh. Although they disagree somewhat on social policies, economically they can work together effectively. Both are not major parties, so they need eachothers combined popularity to win. Finally is the the Eslah Talaban party. They have gained much popularity since the revolution, for many people believe that if there hadn't have been a revolution, there might not have been as many wars as there have been recently. Many people have died, and so more people turn to the Eslah Talaban party to solve this."

pers.103.a:0 "We have more important matters than a silly bear!"
pers.103.b:0 "We must purchase Rostam!"

pers.104.t:0 "Rostam has been sold"
pers.104.d:0 "Rostam the bear was sold to a Polish merchant passing through [PER.GetNameDef]. It seems the Polish merchant caravan was deeply amused by the military bear and as soon as they found out he was up for sale they purchased him. They have even began to call him a new name, Wojtek."
pers.104.a:0 "Alas, Wojtek's fate shall take him to Poland."

### Decisions ###

PER_coring_conquered_territory:0 "새로운 영토 통합"
PER_core_afghan_land:0 "헤라트 통합"
PER_core_afghan_land_desc:0 "Now that we have gained control of our lands in Afghanistan again, we can begin to integrate it into [PER.GetNameDef]. However, it is going to take decades to fully intergrate the eastern area due to their Pashtun ethnic majority. In the west of Afghanistan, the population is majority Hazara, a group we can more easily integrate into our nation. The Pashtuns most likely will resist our attempts, but eventually they will accept our leadership."
PER_core_azerbaijani_land:0 "아제르바이잔 통합"
PER_core_azerbaijani_land_desc:0 "Azerbaijan is now under our direct rule again. After some time, most Azerbaijanis will give up on their dream of their own state, and will accept our leadership. Although there will be some resistance to our rule, we have a very large Azerbaijani minority, and the nation of Azerbaijan only existed for a few decades. Therefore, Azerbaijani resistance will be weak and futile."
PER_core_baluchistan:0 "발루치스탄 통합"
PER_core_baluchistan_desc:0 "The state of Baluchistan has been returned to our control. The Baluchi people are a large ethnic group in our nation, so we should be able to integrate the Baluchi population fully into our state. However, they will resist our rule, due to the fact that they have been under Indian control for much time."
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_category:0 "서부 확장"
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_decfision:0 "오스만은 약하다!"
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_decfision_desc:0 "Recently, Egypt has declared war on the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans have been dominating the Middle East for centuries, and now it is our moment to seek revenge. They have been showing weakness since even before the beginning of the first Weltkrieg, and now it is our time to put an end to the sick man that is the Ottomans."
PER_country_namechange_decision:0 "국명을 이란으로 변경"
PER_country_namechange_decision_desc:0 "Pressure is mounting from modernizing elements within our nation to push for the international community to refer to us as "Iran", the name we use for ourselves, over the outdated exonym "Persia". Quite why this is a matter of such debate we're not really sure."
PER_IRAN:0 "새로운 국명은 이란이다"
